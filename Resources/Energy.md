# Nuclear Energy
Nuclear energy is the energy stored in the nuclei of atoms. It can be harnessed through nuclear reactions - fission and fusion. In nuclear fission, the nucleus of an atom splits into two smaller nuclei, releasing a large amount of energy. This is the process used in nuclear power plants, where uranium or plutonium isotopes are typically used as fuel. Nuclear fusion, on the other hand, involves combining two light nuclei to form a heavier nucleus, releasing energy. This is the process that powers the sun and other stars.
- 1 kilogram uranium-235 has a max potential of 24,000 megawatt-hours assuming a reactor with 100% efficiency; modern reactors achieve 30-40% efficiency.
# Thermal Energy


1. **Thermal Energy**: Energy derived from heat. This can be used for heating buildings, cooking food, or even in some engines.

2. **Electrical Energy**: Energy derived from the flow of electric charge. This is used to power most modern devices and appliances.

3. **Steam Energy**: Energy derived from steam. This is often used in power plants to turn turbines and generate electricity.

4. **Solar Energy**: Energy derived from the sun's rays. This can be used to generate electricity or heat.

5. **Wind Energy**: Energy derived from the wind. This is used to turn wind turbines and generate electricity.

6. **Hydroelectric Energy**: Energy derived from the movement of water. This is often used in dams to generate electricity.

7. **Nuclear Energy**: Energy derived from nuclear reactions. This is used in nuclear power plants to generate electricity.

8. **Chemical Energy**: Energy derived from chemical reactions. This is found in things like batteries, food, and gasoline.

9. **Mechanical Energy**: Energy associated with the motion or position of objects. This is found in moving objects like cars or wind-up toys.

10. **Kinetic Energy**: Energy associated with motion. This is a form of mechanical energy.

11. **Potential Energy**: Energy associated with an object's position. This is another form of mechanical energy.

12. **Radiant Energy**: Energy carried by light. This includes not only visible light but all electromagnetic radiation.

13. **Magnetic Energy**: Energy associated with magnetic fields.

14. **Gravitational Energy**: Energy associated with the gravitational attraction between objects.

Remember that in the real world, energy can often be converted from one form to another. For example, a wind turbine converts wind energy into mechanical energy and then into electrical energy. Also, consider how the energy will be stored, transported, and utilized within your game. For example, will players have access to batteries, power lines, or fuel tanks? Will they need to build infrastructure to use certain types of energy? And will different forms of energy have different environmental impacts in your game world?
