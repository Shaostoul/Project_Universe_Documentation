# Ethics in Project Universe

## Overview
Ethics play a central role in *Project Universe*, guiding both the development of the game and the player's experience. This document outlines the core ethical principles that the project and its community aim to uphold, ensuring that the game reflects values of altruism, sustainability, and humanityâ€™s greater good. However, while the game promotes nonviolence between humans, there are scenarios where violence is inevitable for survival against hostile alien species or monsters.

## Core Ethical Principles
1. **Altruism**
   - The game emphasizes the value of helping others without expecting anything in return. It teaches players that collaboration, cooperation, and selflessness are essential to building a unified, sustainable society.
  
2. **Sustainability**
   - All game mechanics, especially resource management, are designed to teach the importance of frugality and maximizing the use of available resources. Players are encouraged to respect the environment and foster long-term survival and prosperity.

3. **Inclusion and Diversity**
   - The *Project Universe* community welcomes people from all backgrounds, and the game reflects a world where diversity is celebrated. Ethical behavior in-game means recognizing and respecting different perspectives, cultures, and ideas.
  
4. **Nonviolence (Human Conflict)**
   - *Project Universe* promotes peaceful solutions between humans. Players are guided toward cooperation and diplomacy. PvP combat is only encouraged in competitive scenarios where players consent to engage in battles for sport, training, or skill development.

5. **Violence for Survival (Alien/Monster Conflict)**
   - While nonviolence is prioritized between humans, players may encounter hostile aliens, monsters, or demons that seek to destroy or consume humanity, with no option for diplomacy. In such cases, violence is necessary for survival, and players are permitted to defend themselves and their communities from existential threats.

6. **Responsibility**
   - Players are expected to make responsible decisions with consequences. The game encourages mindful choices, especially when it comes to resource use, relationships, and long-term planning. Even in combat scenarios, responsible and ethical decisions should guide the player's actions.

## Ethical Gameplay Decisions
- Players will frequently face decisions that have ethical ramifications, such as:
  - Balancing personal needs with the greater good of the community.
  - Deciding how to distribute limited resources.
  - When to engage in violence for survival and when diplomacy or nonviolent solutions are viable.

## Ethical Game Development
1. **Open Source and Public Domain**
   - The game is developed openly, with contributions from a global community. All assets and resources are freely available to anyone, reflecting the ethical commitment to transparency and shared progress.
  
2. **Respect for Volunteer Contributions**
   - Volunteers are the backbone of *Project Universe*. Their work is recognized and valued, and they are encouraged to contribute in ways that align with their interests and skills without exploitation.

3. **Education and Empowerment**
   - The game is designed not only to entertain but also to educate. Ethical game development means empowering players with knowledge and skills they can apply in real life, promoting autonomy and self-sustainability.

## Challenges and Ethical Dilemmas
- While *Project Universe* upholds strong ethical principles, the game will intentionally introduce players to complex ethical dilemmas that reflect real-world challenges, such as:
  - The balance between individualism and collectivism.
  - Scarcity of resources and decision-making under pressure.
  - The consequences of technological advancements on society and the environment.
  - The moral complexity of choosing when to engage in violence versus pursuing peaceful solutions.

## Player Code of Conduct
- Players are encouraged to:
  - Show respect and kindness to other players.
  - Engage in constructive feedback and collaboration.
  - Avoid harmful behaviors, both in-game and in the community, such as harassment, discrimination, or exploitation.
  - Use violence only in scenarios where survival is at stake, particularly when facing non-human threats.

## Conclusion
Ethics in *Project Universe* guide not only the narrative and gameplay but also how the game itself is created. The ultimate goal is to foster a community and game world that promotes unity, compassion, and the betterment of humanity, while recognizing the need for defense against external threats.
