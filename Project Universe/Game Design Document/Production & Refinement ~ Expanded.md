# **Production & Refinement: Expanded**

1. **Crafting**:
    * **Materials Preparation**: Before crafting can begin, raw materials may need preliminary processing. For instance, hemp would be processed to obtain fibers, which can then be used for crafting.
    * **Crafting Stations**: Different stations for different crafts, e.g., a blacksmith's anvil for weapons or a tailor's bench for clothes.
        - **Upgrades**: As players progress, they can upgrade crafting stations for efficiency or to unlock advanced crafting recipes.
    * **Tools & Equipment**: Players would need certain tools for specific crafts. For example, a hammer for blacksmithing or a needle for tailoring.
    * **Recipes & Blueprints**: Players start with basic crafting knowledge and can acquire more recipes/blueprints through exploration, trade, or research.
        - **Research & Experimentation**: Allow players to experiment with materials, potentially discovering new crafting recipes.
    * **Wear & Tear**: Crafted items like armor, weapons, and tools may degrade over time, requiring repairs or replacements.
    * **Specialization**: As players craft more, they can specialize in certain areas, becoming master blacksmiths, tailors, etc., which can introduce quality tiers to crafted items.

2. **Building**:
    * **Blueprints & Designs**: Players can either use preset designs or create custom ones for structures, vehicles, and spacecraft.
        - **Custom Designs**: Introduce a design interface where players can draft custom interiors or vehicles.
    * **Construction Process**:
        - **Foundation**: Everything starts with a solid base. Whether it's laying the foundation of a structure or the chassis of a vehicle.
        - **Modular Building**: Allow players to build in sections or modules. This can be especially useful for large structures or ships.
        - **Assembly**: After crafting components, players will assemble them to create functional machines or vehicles.
    * **Machines & Equipment**:
        - **Component Crafting**: Before a machine (like a furnace or loom) can be built, players craft its individual components. For instance, a furnace might require crafted bricks, metal bands, and a crafted grate.
        - **Installation & Integration**: Once built, machines may need to be integrated into the ship's power grid or plumbing system.
        - **Maintenance & Upgrades**: Machines degrade with use. Players will need to maintain them, replace worn-out components, and can potentially upgrade them for better efficiency or new functions.
    * **Safety & Hazards**: Building might come with hazards. For instance, constructing a spacecraft might expose players to harmful materials or the vacuum of space, requiring protective gear.
    * **Specialized Buildings**: As players progress, they can construct specialized buildings or rooms, like a research lab, which can unlock further gameplay elements.
