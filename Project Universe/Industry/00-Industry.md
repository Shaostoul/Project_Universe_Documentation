The **Industry** section is where large-scale resource management, manufacturing, and mass production take place within Project Universe. This area is designed to support high-capacity activities that go beyond the scope of individual player homes, focusing on community-driven and industrial-scale operations. Whether itâ€™s mining asteroids, refining raw materials, or fabricating complex machinery, the Industrial sector is the hub for large-scale collaboration and progress.

# Purpose
The Industrial zone is essential for processing resources, fabricating advanced materials, and supporting the infrastructure that enables the player community to expand beyond their personal homesteads. It provides the tools and environment necessary for managing resources at a macro scale, contributing to the larger goals of space exploration, community projects, and sustainability.

# Features
1. **Ore Refinery**: Processes raw materials such as asteroid ore into refined resources like metal ingots or alloys.
2. **Smelting Facility**: High-capacity furnaces designed to convert raw ore into usable metals for industrial and community purposes.
3. **Fabrication Plant**: Turns refined materials into essential components for construction, machinery, and large-scale infrastructure projects.
4. **Public Resource Depot**: A central hub for dropping off mined resources, with a rewards system for player contributions.
5. **Recycling Center**: Breaks down old or broken items into reusable raw materials for further production.
6. **Mass Production Lines**: Automated systems that fabricate items in bulk, from spaceship parts to automated farming tools.
7. **Mining Rig Operations**: Supports players who prefer gathering resources through large-scale mining expeditions, contributing materials to the industrial supply chain.
8. **Advanced Power Systems**: Manage large-scale energy production, ensuring continuous operation of industrial facilities.
9. **Collaborative Projects**: Large-scale community projects that require collective effort and industrial resources, such as constructing space stations or planetary infrastructure.
