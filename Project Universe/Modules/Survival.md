Survival mechanics require players to manage their character’s basic needs and environment to ensure long-term viability during exploration and resource gathering. It is a fundamental aspect that adds challenge and realism to gameplay.

**Health and Vital Signs**: Players must monitor their character’s health, oxygen levels, and other vital signs. Environmental hazards such as radiation, temperature extremes, and physical injuries can impact health, requiring players to use medical supplies or repair equipment to stay functional.

**Food and Water Management**: Managing food and water supplies is critical for survival. Players need to grow, collect, or trade for these resources. Efficient storage and rationing systems help maintain supply levels, ensuring the character’s needs are consistently met during long missions.

**Environmental Hazards**: Space environments present various dangers, including asteroid debris, hostile entities, and extreme temperatures. Players must prepare by equipping protective gear, managing ship shielding, and staying within safe zones to minimize exposure to these hazards.

**Ship and Habitat Maintenance**: Keeping the ship’s life support and habitat systems functioning is essential for survival. Players must repair and maintain these systems to provide a safe and livable environment, especially during extended missions or in hostile territory.

**Resource Utilization**: Efficient use of resources, such as power, food, and medical supplies, is critical to maintaining the player’s well-being. Players must balance immediate needs with long-term survival strategies, ensuring they have sufficient resources for future challenges.

**Story Integration**: Survival mechanics tie into the narrative, with missions requiring players to overcome harsh conditions or repair critical systems. Players may encounter scenarios where managing survival becomes crucial to progress, adding depth and urgency to the gameplay experience.
