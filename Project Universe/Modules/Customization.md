This extends to choosing skill specializations that influence gameplay style, enabling players to build characters suited to combat, crafting, exploration, or support roles.

Customization options include painting the ship, adding decals, and rearranging internal components like storage units, workstations, and living quarters to optimize space and functionality.

Modifications might include attachments for weapons, durability upgrades for tools, or efficiency enhancements for mining equipment.

**Environment Personalization**: Within their ship, players can decorate and organize living and working spaces, making their environment feel unique. This includes placing furniture, lighting, and personal items that reflect their style and achievements.
