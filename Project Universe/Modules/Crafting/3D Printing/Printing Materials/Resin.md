Resin, typically used in SLA and DLP 3D printing, is known for producing highly detailed prints with smooth surfaces and excellent accuracy. Available in a variety of formulations (standard, tough, flexible, high-temperature, etc.), resin is ideal for applications needing intricate details but requires more handling precautions due to its toxicity and the post-curing process.

- **Properties**: High precision, smooth finish, brittle (varies by formulation), UV-sensitive.
- **Best For**: Miniatures, jewelry, dental models, prototypes, and applications requiring high-detail accuracy.

- **Toxicity and Food Safety**:
  - **During Manufacturing**: Resin production involves chemicals that are generally toxic until fully cured.
  - **During Printing**: Releases toxic fumes, and contact with liquid resin is harmful to skin and eyes. Always wear gloves and ensure proper ventilation.
  - **Post-Printing**: Not food-safe due to potential leaching and chemical residue, even after curing.
  - **Recyclability**: Not easily recyclable and should be disposed of as hazardous waste. Consult local guidelines for disposal.

- **Advantages**:
  - **High Detail and Precision**: Resin printing produces extremely fine details and smooth surfaces, ideal for intricate designs.
  - **Wide Range of Properties**: Different resins (e.g., tough, flexible, castable) allow customization for specific applications.
  - **Fast Layer Curing**: Fast curing with UV light, allowing for efficient production of detailed parts.
  - **Smooth Finish**: Requires minimal post-processing to achieve a finished look.

- **Limitations**:
  - **Brittleness**: Standard resin can be brittle, especially for thin or load-bearing parts.
  - **UV Sensitivity**: Resin parts degrade when exposed to sunlight; UV-resistant formulations help but are more costly.
  - **Hazardous Handling**: Requires careful handling, as liquid resin is toxic and can cause skin irritation.
  - **Cost and Waste**: Resin can be expensive and requires additional post-processing, creating more waste.

- **Print Settings**:
  - **Layer Height**: 0.025–0.1 mm (varies by printer and detail level)
  - **Exposure Time**: Varies by printer; typically set in the slicer software based on resin type
  - **Lift Speed**: Varies by printer and model height

- **Applications**:
  - **Miniatures and Models**: Ideal for creating highly detailed models, such as tabletop miniatures.
  - **Dental and Medical Models**: Used in dental casts and medical models requiring fine detail.
  - **Jewelry**: Perfect for intricate designs, including prototypes and castable models for jewelry.
  - **Prototyping**: Especially useful for designs where detail and surface finish are paramount.

- **Post-Processing**:
  - **Washing**: Parts must be cleaned with isopropyl alcohol to remove uncured resin residue.
  - **Curing**: UV curing is necessary to fully harden and stabilize the printed part.
  - **Sanding and Painting**: Resin prints can be sanded and painted for further finishing.

Resin’s fine detail and finish make it a popular choice for applications requiring precision, though its handling requirements and brittleness must be managed carefully. With proper safety measures, resin 3D printing delivers high-quality results ideal for prototyping, art, and intricate designs.
