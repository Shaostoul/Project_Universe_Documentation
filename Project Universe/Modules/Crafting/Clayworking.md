Clayworking aka ceramics is the art and craft of shaping, drying, and firing clay to create functional or artistic pieces, such as pottery, sculptures, tiles, and decorative objects. It encompasses various techniques, materials, and processes, from hand-building to wheel-throwing and glazing.

**Types of Clay:**  
1. **Earthenware** – Low-fired, porous, soft; often red or brown; best for decorative or low-use items.
2. **Stoneware** – Mid- to high-fired, durable, non-porous; ideal for tableware and functional items.
3. **Porcelain** – High-fired, fine, translucent, and non-porous; prized for its delicate and smooth finish.

**Basic Techniques:**  
- **Hand-Building**: Using hands and simple tools to form clay, including slab, coil, and pinch techniques.
- **Wheel-Throwing**: Spinning clay on a potter's wheel to create symmetrical forms.
- **Slip Casting**: Pouring liquid clay (slip) into molds for precise forms.

**Firing Methods:**  
1. **Kiln Firing** – Using an electric, gas, or wood kiln to harden clay at controlled temperatures.
2. **Pit Firing** – Traditional method using an open fire or pit, producing unique textures and colors.
3. **Raku Firing** – Quick firing process where pieces are removed from the kiln while hot, creating distinctive finishes.

**Glazing and Decoration:**  
- **Glazes**: Applied before a final firing to create a glassy, sealed surface that can be glossy, matte, or textured.
- **Surface Treatments**: Include carving, stamping, painting, and inlaying for additional detail.

**Health & Safety:**  
- **Ventilation**: Proper ventilation is essential when firing to avoid inhaling toxic fumes.
- **Protective Equipment**: Gloves, masks, and goggles are recommended, especially when working with glazes and during firing.
- **Safe Disposal**: Dispose of clay and glaze waste responsibly, as some materials contain heavy metals.

**Applications:**  
Ceramics are used for functional items like bowls and mugs, artistic sculptures, tiles, and even industrial components due to their heat resistance, durability, and aesthetic versatility.
