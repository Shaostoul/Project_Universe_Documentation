Crafting allows players to create tools, equipment, and ship upgrades using resources collected from mining and exploration. It is a core mechanic that supports progression, enabling players to enhance their abilities, improve their ship, and access new gameplay features.

**Crafting Stations**: Players must construct and use specialized stations (e.g., workbenches, forges, and laboratories) to craft different item types. These stations can be upgraded to unlock advanced recipes and increase crafting efficiency.

**Resource Requirements**: Each item or upgrade requires specific resources, encouraging players to explore and gather the necessary materials. Players must manage their inventory and strategically decide what to craft based on their immediate needs and available supplies.

**Item Customization**: Crafting systems allow players to customize and enhance crafted items, such as modifying weapons for better damage or durability or upgrading tools to be more efficient. This provides flexibility for players to tailor their gear to fit their playstyle.

**Skill Integration**: Crafting is tied to skill progression, with players gaining experience as they create items. Higher skill levels unlock advanced recipes and crafting bonuses, rewarding players for investing time in developing their abilities.

**Story and Missions**: Crafting often plays a role in missions and story arcs, requiring players to create specific tools, ship components, or other items necessary to complete objectives and progress through the gameâ€™s narrative.
