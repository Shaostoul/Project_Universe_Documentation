### **1. Tilapia (Nile Tilapia - *Oreochromis niloticus*)**
- **Why Feasible**: Tilapia are a hardy, fast-growing species well-suited for aquaponics systems. They can tolerate a range of water conditions, including varying pH and temperature, and they thrive in relatively shallow water environments like 1-meter deep tanks.
- **Advantages**:
  - High growth rate and efficient feed conversion.
  - Tolerant to crowding, making them suitable for smaller, interconnected tanks.
  - Can consume a plant-based diet, which fits well with integrated aquaponics systems.
- **Optimal Conditions**:
  - **Temperature**: 25-30°C (77-86°F).
  - **pH**: 6.5-8.5.
  - **Dissolved Oxygen**: 4-6 mg/L.

### **2. Catfish (Channel Catfish - *Ictalurus punctatus*)**
- **Why Feasible**: Catfish are bottom dwellers, making them ideal for the 1-meter deep setup. They are also resilient and can adapt to lower dissolved oxygen levels, which is beneficial in a system with a large surface area but shallow depth.
- **Advantages**:
  - Tolerant of varied water quality and temperature conditions.
  - Compatible with other fish species in multi-species systems.
  - Omnivorous diet, able to eat a variety of feeds and plant matter.
- **Optimal Conditions**:
  - **Temperature**: 22-28°C (72-82°F).
  - **pH**: 6.0-8.0.
  - **Dissolved Oxygen**: 3-5 mg/L.

### **3. Carp (Common Carp - *Cyprinus carpio*)**
- **Why Feasible**: Carp are highly adaptable and can live in a wide range of water conditions, including shallow and interconnected tanks. They are also resilient to fluctuations in water temperature and quality, making them suitable for controlled habitats.
- **Advantages**:
  - Tolerant to low oxygen levels and a variety of pH levels.
  - Can be fed a variety of plant-based foods and organic matter.
  - Grow relatively quickly and have a high reproductive rate.
- **Optimal Conditions**:
  - **Temperature**: 18-25°C (64-77°F).
  - **pH**: 6.5-8.0.
  - **Dissolved Oxygen**: 3-6 mg/L.

### **4. Trout (Rainbow Trout - *Oncorhynchus mykiss*)**
- **Why Feasible**: Although trout prefer cooler temperatures and higher oxygen levels, they can still thrive in well-managed aquaponics systems that provide consistent water flow and oxygenation.
- **Advantages**:
  - Fast growth rate when kept under optimal conditions.
  - High market value and nutritional benefits.
- **Optimal Conditions**:
  - **Temperature**: 10-16°C (50-60°F).
  - **pH**: 6.5-7.5.
  - **Dissolved Oxygen**: 6-8 mg/L (requires good aeration).

### **5. Barramundi (*Lates calcarifer*)**
- **Why Feasible**: Barramundi are adaptable to aquaponic systems, particularly in tropical and warm environments. They can grow quickly and have high protein yields.
- **Advantages**:
  - Can tolerate crowded conditions, making them suitable for interconnected tank systems.
  - Fast-growing and efficient at converting feed into body mass.
- **Optimal Conditions**:
  - **Temperature**: 26-30°C (79-86°F).
  - **pH**: 6.8-8.2.
  - **Dissolved Oxygen**: 5-7 mg/L.

### **Recommendation**
**Tilapia** and **Catfish** are the most feasible options for this setup due to their hardiness, ability to tolerate crowded conditions, and adaptability to a range of water qualities and temperatures. Tilapia, in particular, is ideal for aquaponics and shallow systems as they efficiently convert plant-based feeds into protein, fitting perfectly into a closed-loop ecosystem.
