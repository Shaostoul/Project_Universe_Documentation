### **1. Freshwater Mussels (*Anodonta spp.* and *Unio spp.*)**
- **Why Feasible**: Freshwater mussels are highly adaptable and work well in confined aquaculture systems like interconnected tanks. They filter feed, improving water quality by removing excess nutrients and particles.
- **Advantages**:
  - Filter water and reduce organic load, benefiting the overall system.
  - Low maintenance; they do not require additional feed as they consume suspended particles.
  - Hardy and can survive in various water conditions.
- **Optimal Conditions**:
  - **Temperature**: 15-25°C (59-77°F).
  - **pH**: 6.5-8.0.
  - **Dissolved Oxygen**: 5-8 mg/L.

### **2. Freshwater Clams (*Corbicula fluminea*)**
- **Why Feasible**: These clams are efficient filter feeders that thrive in freshwater aquaponics systems. They help maintain water clarity by filtering phytoplankton and detritus.
- **Advantages**:
  - Improves water quality by removing suspended particles and algae.
  - Suitable for relatively shallow water environments.
  - Can reproduce quickly, maintaining population levels.
- **Optimal Conditions**:
  - **Temperature**: 15-30°C (59-86°F).
  - **pH**: 6.5-8.2.
  - **Dissolved Oxygen**: 5-7 mg/L.

### **3. Eastern Oysters (*Crassostrea virginica*)**
- **Why Feasible**: Although typically found in brackish water, Eastern oysters can adapt to lower salinity environments with proper acclimation. They are efficient filter feeders, which makes them valuable for maintaining water quality.
- **Advantages**:
  - Removes algae and organic particles from the water, improving system health.
  - High market value and nutritional benefits.
  - Can tolerate a range of temperatures and salinity levels with proper adjustment.
- **Optimal Conditions**:
  - **Temperature**: 10-28°C (50-82°F).
  - **Salinity**: 5-30 ppt (parts per thousand).
  - **Dissolved Oxygen**: 5-8 mg/L.

### **4. Zebra Mussels (*Dreissena polymorpha*)**
- **Why Feasible**: Zebra mussels are adaptable filter feeders capable of thriving in interconnected tank systems. They efficiently clean water by filtering suspended particles, enhancing overall water quality.
- **Advantages**:
  - Fast reproduction rate and easy to manage in closed systems.
  - High filtering capacity, beneficial for maintaining clarity and nutrient balance.
- **Caution**: Can be invasive in natural ecosystems but suitable for controlled, isolated systems like space habitats.
- **Optimal Conditions**:
  - **Temperature**: 12-25°C (54-77°F).
  - **pH**: 6.5-8.0.
  - **Dissolved Oxygen**: 5-7 mg/L.

### **5. Asian Clams (*Corbicula fluminea*)**
- **Why Feasible**: Known for their hardiness and adaptability, Asian clams thrive in various freshwater conditions and have similar benefits to other freshwater clam species. They filter feed efficiently, improving water quality by removing algae and organic matter.
- **Advantages**:
  - Easy to maintain and fast-growing in small-scale aquaponics setups.
  - Improves water quality, reducing the need for additional filtration systems.
  - Can adapt to fluctuating water conditions within the optimal range.
- **Optimal Conditions**:
  - **Temperature**: 15-28°C (59-82°F).
  - **pH**: 6.5-8.5.
  - **Dissolved Oxygen**: 5-7 mg/L.

### **Recommendation**
**Freshwater Mussels** and **Freshwater Clams (Corbicula)** are the most suitable for this setup due to their adaptability, efficiency in filtering water, and minimal maintenance requirements. They help maintain water quality by removing algae and organic particles, ensuring a balanced, healthy aquaponic system.
