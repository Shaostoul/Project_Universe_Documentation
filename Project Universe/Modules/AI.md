AI systems are essential companions that support players with tasks such as resource collection, ship management, combat, and exploration. These units can be customized and upgraded to fit player needs, offering options like mining drones, maintenance units, and combat drones, each tailored for specific roles.

**Customization and Upgrades** allow players to enhance AI units with programming modules, performance boosts, and behavioral settings. Players can choose between autonomous operations, where AI manage routine tasks, or direct command mode for precise control during critical moments like combat or resource gathering.

**Interaction and Evolution**: AI companions adapt and "learn" based on their activities. As AI units gain experience, they become more efficient, improving their performance in tasks such as mining, scanning, or repairs. This evolution aligns AI behavior with the player's style, making them increasingly effective over time.

**Strategic Role**: AI units significantly impact gameplay by boosting efficiency and mitigating risks. They automate routine operations, freeing up players to focus on missions or exploration, while detecting threats like enemy ships or environmental hazards, giving players time to respond strategically.

**Story and Integration**: AI systems are woven into the gameâ€™s story arcs, with missions that involve upgrading, rescuing, or reprogramming them. Players might face rogue AI units that offer unique challenges, turning these systems into central elements of both gameplay and narrative progression.

**Multiplayer Potential**: Future updates could expand AI roles to multiplayer, enabling players to link AI systems for cooperative missions or deploy AI companions to assist others. This feature would enhance collaborative gameplay while also introducing competitive AI dynamics.
