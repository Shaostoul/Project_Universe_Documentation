1. **Nuclear Energy**:
   - Uranium or plutonium atoms are split in a reactor to release heat.
   - Heat generates steam, which drives a turbine connected to a generator, producing electricity.

2. **Solar Energy**:
   - **Photovoltaic (PV) Cells**: Sunlight hits PV cells, generating electric current through semiconductor materials.
   - **Solar Thermal**: Mirrors focus sunlight to heat fluid, producing steam that drives a turbine to generate electricity.

3. **Wind Energy**:
   - Wind turns turbine blades connected to a generator.
   - The rotation of the blades generates mechanical energy, which is converted into electricity.

4. **Hydroelectric Energy**:
   - Flowing or falling water (often from a dam) spins a turbine.
   - The turbine powers a generator, converting kinetic energy of water into electricity.

5. **Tidal Energy**:
   - **Tidal Stream**: Moving tides turn underwater turbines, generating electricity.
   - **Tidal Barrage**: Water flows in and out of a dam-like structure, driving turbines as tides rise and fall.

6. **Wave Energy**:
   - Wave motion moves floating or submerged devices, driving pistons or turbines.
   - This movement generates electricity, often converted directly or stored in batteries.

7. **Geothermal Energy**:
   - Heat from underground reservoirs heats water, producing steam.
   - Steam drives a turbine connected to a generator to produce electricity.

8. **Biomass and Bioenergy**:
   - **Direct Combustion**: Biomass is burned to produce heat, which can generate steam for turbines.
   - **Biochemical Conversion**: Microorganisms break down organic material, producing biogas (methane) for combustion.
   - **Thermochemical Conversion**: Biomass is gasified or pyrolyzed to create biofuels for combustion or refining.

9. **Fossil Fuels (Coal, Oil, Natural Gas)**:
   - **Combustion**: Fuels are burned to produce heat, creating steam.
   - Steam drives turbines connected to generators, producing electricity.

10. **Battery Energy Storage**:
   - **Charge**: Electric current flows into the battery, storing energy in chemical bonds.
   - **Discharge**: The process reverses, releasing stored energy as electric current.
