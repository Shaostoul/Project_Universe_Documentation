Wireless power transmission (WPT) is the transfer of electrical energy without physical wires, allowing devices and systems to receive power remotely. This technology is useful in applications where wiring is impractical, hazardous, or costly, such as powering remote devices, electric vehicles, or implants. WPT methods typically include inductive coupling, resonant inductive coupling, radiofrequency (RF) transmission, and laser-based systems, each with varying applications and ranges.

### Types of Wireless Power Transmission

1. **Inductive Coupling**:
   - **Process**: Electricity is transferred through magnetic fields between two coils in close proximity. 
   - **Applications**: Commonly used in wireless charging for smartphones, electric toothbrushes, and small devices.
   - **Range**: Short-range, generally less than a few centimeters.
   - **Limitations**: Limited range and efficiency decrease sharply with distance.

2. **Resonant Inductive Coupling**:
   - **Process**: Similar to inductive coupling but tuned to resonate at a specific frequency, allowing power transfer over greater distances.
   - **Applications**: Wireless charging of larger devices like electric vehicles, medical implants, and industrial equipment.
   - **Range**: Medium-range, typically up to several meters.
   - **Limitations**: Requires precise alignment, and efficiency declines with distance.

3. **Radiofrequency (RF) Transmission**:
   - **Process**: Electrical energy is converted into RF waves and transmitted to a receiver that converts it back into usable power.
   - **Applications**: Powering remote sensors, small IoT devices, and low-power devices where wires are impractical.
   - **Range**: Medium to long-range, depending on power and frequency.
   - **Limitations**: Limited power capacity, making it suitable only for low-power applications.

4. **Microwave Transmission**:
   - **Process**: Energy is transmitted in the form of microwaves, which is captured by rectennas (rectifying antennas) that convert it back to electricity.
   - **Applications**: Potentially useful for space-based solar power, powering drones or other remote systems over long distances.
   - **Range**: Long-range, potentially hundreds of kilometers (e.g., from satellites to Earth).
   - **Limitations**: Requires line of sight and precise targeting, and can pose safety risks for humans and wildlife.

5. **Laser-Based Transmission**:
   - **Process**: Laser beams carry energy to photovoltaic cells or receivers that convert it back into electricity.
   - **Applications**: Used for powering drones, satellites, and remote sensors in areas with no physical connections.
   - **Range**: Long-range, capable of distances in kilometers.
   - **Limitations**: Requires clear line of sight, can be affected by weather, and poses safety risks.
