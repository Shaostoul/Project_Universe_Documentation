### Wind Energy

**Overview**: Wind energy harnesses the kinetic energy of moving air through wind turbines. This energy is converted into mechanical power, which a generator then transforms into electricity. Currently, wind energy is the third-largest source of electricity in the U.S., powering around 39 million homes. Wind turbine efficiency has steadily improved, with new technology enabling larger and more effective installations.

**Energy Production**:
- **Capacity**: Modern wind turbines in the U.S. contribute to a collective capacity of 125 GW. Each turbine can produce between 2-4 MW, depending on size, location, and wind conditions.
- **Lifetime Energy Production**: A typical 2 MW turbine operating at 35% efficiency produces around 6.1 GWh annually. Over a 20-year lifespan, this equates to approximately 122 GWh.
- **Efficiency**: Average capacity factors are 35-40% for onshore turbines and up to 50% for offshore.

**Lifespan**:
- **Expected Operational Lifetime**: Generally 20 years, with the potential for extension to 25 years with proactive maintenance.
- **Repowering**: Many wind farms opt to replace aging turbines with newer technology, which can increase energy production by 10% or more without needing new permits or infrastructure changes.

**Maintenance and Operating Costs**:
- **Initial Maintenance Costs**: New turbines have maintenance costs around 10-15% of the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE).
- **Aging Costs**: As turbines age, maintenance costs can rise to 25-35% of LCOE. Cumulative maintenance costs can reach 65-95% of the original investment cost over the lifespan.
- **Common Failures**: Electrical and mechanical failures are common, particularly in electrical systems, blades, and gearboxes. Regular component replacements are required, with gearboxes and blades often needing replacement within 10 years.
- **Environmental Stressors**: Wind turbines, especially offshore, are prone to wear from environmental factors like wind, salt, and water exposure, increasing maintenance needs and potential downtime.

**Decommissioning**:
- **End-of-Life Options**: At the end of a turbine’s lifecycle, operators can decommission it, repower it, or leave it standing if dismantling costs are too high.
- **Decommissioning Costs**: Decommissioning a single turbine can cost up to $200,000, excluding potential recycling revenue. Given the high costs, many operators repower turbines instead.
- **Recycling Challenges**: Around 85% of turbine components, such as steel and electronics, can be recycled. However, the fiberglass blades are challenging to recycle, often ending up in landfills or repurposed in civil engineering projects. Future blades may use recyclable thermoplastic resin.

**Environmental Impact**:
- **Land Use**: Wind farms typically have a high land requirement for spacing but minimal ground disturbance, allowing for agricultural co-use.
- **Wildlife Impact**: Birds and bats can be affected by turbine blades, though new designs and placements aim to mitigate this impact.

**Pros and Cons**:
- **Advantages**:
  - Zero emissions during operation.
  - Renewable energy source with abundant potential in windy regions.
  - Opportunity for job creation and rural development.

- **Disadvantages**:
  - High initial setup and decommissioning costs.
  - Efficiency varies with weather, and energy production can be inconsistent.
  - Environmental and wildlife impacts, though these are decreasing with technology improvements.

Wind energy is a robust but complex option for renewable energy, with considerable potential balanced by maintenance and environmental factors that require long-term planning and management.
