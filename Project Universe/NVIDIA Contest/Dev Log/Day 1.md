Reflections:
This initial phase has been crucial in solidifying the project's vision and scope. The personal connection to the project, stemming from my experience with Crohn's disease, adds a unique perspective and drive to create something truly impactful. The challenge lies in balancing the ambitious long-term vision with the immediate needs of the contest submission. Moving forward, it will be essential to focus on the core features that showcase the required NVIDIA and LlamaIndex technologies while laying the groundwork for future expansion.
