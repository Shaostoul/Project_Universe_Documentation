# Facilities

The **Facilities** section encompasses the core infrastructure of **Project Universe**, divided into two major areas: **Home** and **Industrial**. These facilities provide the necessary tools, resources, and environments for players to engage with both personal and large-scale community-driven projects. From individual homes designed for self-sufficiency and learning, to vast industrial zones powering the collective ambitions of humanity, the Facilities sector is the backbone of resource management, education, and collaboration.
