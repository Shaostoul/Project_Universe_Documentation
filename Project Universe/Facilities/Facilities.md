The **Facilities** section encompasses the key areas where players interact, work, and build within Project Universe. Divided into three main categories—Home, Industrial, and Social—these facilities provide a wide range of tools, resources, and environments to help players manage their personal spaces, contribute to large-scale industrial projects, and engage in community-driven social activities.

Each facility serves a unique purpose, blending in-game mechanics with real-world applications, encouraging both personal development and collaborative efforts.
