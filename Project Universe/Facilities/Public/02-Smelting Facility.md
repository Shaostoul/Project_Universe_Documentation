The **Smelting Facility** is a crucial part of the Industrial sector, where raw ores are heated to extract base metals like iron, copper, and aluminum. This facility plays a key role in mass-producing metal ingots, which are essential for crafting, construction, and large-scale industrial projects. By using high-temperature furnaces, the smelting process separates impurities from the molten metal, producing pure ingots that are ready for use in various applications.

# Features

- Extracts base metals from raw ore using high heat.
- Produces metal ingots such as iron, copper, and aluminum.
- Handles large-scale processing for mass production of materials.
- Separates impurities (slag) from usable metals during the smelting process.
- Requires energy management to maintain furnace operation.
