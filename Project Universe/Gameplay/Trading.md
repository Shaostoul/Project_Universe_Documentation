Trading mechanics allow players to exchange resources, equipment, and information, creating a dynamic in-game economy. It plays a key role in acquiring rare items, optimizing resource management, and fostering relationships with NPCs or other players.

**Market System**: Players access trading hubs or interact with NPC traders to buy and sell resources, equipment, and crafted items. Prices fluctuate based on supply, demand, and market conditions, encouraging players to strategically time their trades for maximum profit.

**Bartering and Negotiation**: Players can negotiate deals or barter directly with NPCs, exchanging goods or services instead of currency. This system adds depth to trading, giving players flexibility in how they acquire needed items, particularly in areas where currency may not be accepted.

**Specialized Goods**: Certain resources and equipment are exclusive to specific regions or NPC factions, incentivizing exploration and building relationships. Players can seek out rare items or trade routes to access these exclusive goods, which are often required for high-level crafting or upgrades.

**Resource Exchange**: Players can convert excess resources into valuable assets, optimizing their inventory and gaining currency or trade goods in return. Efficient trading allows players to build wealth, upgrade their ship, and acquire advanced technology, enhancing overall gameplay progression.

**Trading Missions and Quests**: Some missions involve trading, such as establishing trade routes, fulfilling resource contracts, or smuggling valuable items. These missions offer rewards and progression opportunities, while also integrating trading mechanics with the gameâ€™s narrative.

**Future Multiplayer Integration**: In multiplayer mode, trading extends to player-to-player exchanges, enabling the creation of a player-driven economy. Players can collaborate, establish trade alliances, or compete for control over valuable trade routes, adding a strategic layer to multiplayer gameplay.
