Combat mechanics involve engaging hostile entities using both personal and vehicle mounted weapons. Players manage offensive and defensive tactics, utilizing strategies like target prioritization, evasion maneuvers, and weapon selection to protect resources and allies during encounters.

**Weapon Systems**: Players have access to a variety of weapon types, including lasers, projectile-based weapons, and energy shields for defense. Weapons and systems can be upgraded for improved damage, accuracy, range, or durability, allowing for customization based on combat style.

**Tactical Options**: Combat isn’t just about firepower; players can deploy drones, activate defensive systems, or use environmental elements for cover. Engaging in combat may also require balancing offense and defense to manage ship integrity and maintain critical systems.

**Hostile Entities**: Players face different threats, such as alien creatures, rival factions, or automated defenses around valuable resources. Each type of enemy requires unique strategies, encouraging players to adapt and refine their tactics based on enemy behavior.

**Progression and Upgrades**: Successful combat engagements earn players experience and resources used to unlock new abilities, upgrade weapons, or reinforce defensive capabilities. This progression system allows players to develop specialized combat skills over time.

**Integration with Story and Missions**: Combat is tied to the game’s story arcs and missions, often involving objectives like defending allies, securing resources, or engaging enemy ships during exploration. Players may also encounter scripted battles that are crucial for progressing the main storyline.
