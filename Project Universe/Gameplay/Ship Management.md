Ship management mechanics allow players to maintain, upgrade, and customize their vessel, ensuring it remains efficient and capable in various situations such as combat, exploration, and resource gathering. It is central to gameplay, affecting both mobility and survival.

**System Monitoring and Maintenance**: Players monitor the ship’s critical systems, including life support, engines, power supply, and defense mechanisms. Routine checks and maintenance are essential to keep the ship operating efficiently. Players can repair damage manually or use AI units for automated repairs.

**Upgrades and Customization**: Players can upgrade various ship components, such as thrusters, weapon systems, scanners, and cargo holds. These upgrades improve performance, enhance capabilities, and allow customization based on the player’s needs, whether focusing on combat, exploration, or resource management.

**Modular Design**: The ship’s layout is modular, allowing players to rearrange and expand components like living quarters, storage units, and workstations. This flexibility enables players to optimize space, increase functionality, and create a setup that suits their playstyle.

**Power and Resource Management**: Players must manage the ship’s power supply and allocate resources efficiently. Balancing power between systems like shields, engines, and weapons is crucial, especially in combat or high-risk environments where resource optimization can determine success.

**AI Integration**: AI systems play a role in ship management, assisting with routine tasks such as maintaining engines, monitoring systems, and managing inventory. AI units can be upgraded to increase their efficiency, allowing players to automate tasks and focus on critical operations.

**Story and Mission Impact**: Ship management is tied to the game’s story and missions, with specific objectives requiring upgrades or repairs to progress. Players may need to enhance their ship’s capabilities to access new areas, engage in battles, or complete exploration-based tasks.
