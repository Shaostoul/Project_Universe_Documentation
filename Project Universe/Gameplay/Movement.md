Movement mechanics allow players to navigate their ship and environments efficiently, providing control over their exploration, resource gathering, and combat. It forms the foundation for all gameplay activities, ensuring a smooth and engaging experience.

**Ship Navigation**: Players control their spaceshipâ€™s movement through asteroid fields and space environments, managing speed, direction, and maneuvers. Advanced navigation systems and thruster upgrades improve handling, allowing for precise control and evasive maneuvers during combat or hazardous conditions.

**Character Mobility**: Inside the ship or external environments, players move their character using basic controls, with the ability to walk, sprint, or interact with objects. This mobility is essential for managing ship systems, exploring new areas, or collecting resources.

**Zero-Gravity Movement**: Certain areas may require players to navigate in zero-gravity conditions, using thrusters or tether systems to move. Mastery of these mechanics is crucial for precise maneuvering during spacewalks or repairs outside the ship.

**Upgrades and Enhancements**: Players can upgrade both ship and character movement capabilities, such as enhancing ship thrusters for faster travel or equipping their character with mobility gear for improved speed and agility. These upgrades open up new exploration opportunities and improve overall efficiency.

**Environmental Interactions**: Movement mechanics are tied to environmental factors like terrain, obstacles, and hazards. Players must adapt their movement style to navigate efficiently, whether maneuvering through dense asteroid fields or avoiding hostile entities in confined spaces.

**AI and Companion Support**: AI units and companions can assist with navigation tasks, providing pathfinding assistance or managing certain movement tasks autonomously. This support allows players to focus on other aspects of gameplay while ensuring efficient travel.
