Construction allows players to build and upgrade structures within their ship and external environments. This includes creating workspaces, expanding living quarters, and enhancing ship capabilities to support survival, resource management, and overall efficiency.

**Building Systems**: Players use collected resources to build essential components such as workshops, storage units, power systems, and habitat modules. Structures can be upgraded to improve functionality, increase capacity, or unlock new abilities and tools for the player.

**Customization**: Players have control over the layout and appearance of their structures, personalizing workspaces, living areas, and ship modules. This customization enables players to create a comfortable and efficient environment that matches their gameplay style.

**Automation Integration**: Construction ties into AI systems, allowing players to automate certain tasks. For example, constructing maintenance bays for AI units or setting up automated mining stations helps streamline resource management and improves gameplay efficiency.

**Resource Management**: Construction mechanics are heavily tied to resource gathering. Players must strategically plan their builds based on available materials, balancing immediate needs (e.g., habitat expansion) with long-term investments (e.g., advanced research stations).

**Story and Progression**: Building and upgrading structures often play key roles in story arcs and missions. Players may need to construct specific facilities to complete objectives, unlock new areas, or enhance their ship’s capabilities, driving the game’s progression.
