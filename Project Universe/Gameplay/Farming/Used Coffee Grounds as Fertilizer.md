Used coffee grounds are a popular and effective organic fertilizer for gardening. They contain essential nutrients that benefit plant growth and can be easily recycled from household waste. Coffee grounds improve soil structure, attract beneficial organisms like earthworms, and provide a slow release of nutrients.

## Chemical Information
- **Nutrients**:
  - **Nitrogen (N)**: Approximately 2% by weight. This supports leafy growth and overall plant development.
  - **Phosphorus (P)**: Low levels present, aiding root development and flowering.
  - **Potassium (K)**: Coffee grounds contain potassium, which helps overall plant health and resistance to disease.
  - **Other Elements**: Contains minor amounts of magnesium, calcium, and trace minerals that contribute to soil health.

- **pH**: Coffee grounds are **slightly acidic** when fresh but generally neutral to slightly acidic after use. They do not significantly alter soil pH when used in moderation.

## How Much to Use
- **Direct Application**:
  - Spread a **thin layer** (no more than Â½ inch) of used coffee grounds on the soil surface around plants. Avoid piling them too thick, as this may lead to mold growth.
  - Gently **work the grounds** into the soil to help incorporate them without creating a dense layer that can block air and water.

- **Composting**:
  - Add coffee grounds to your compost pile as a **green material** (high in nitrogen). Balance them with brown materials like dried leaves or cardboard in a 1:4 ratio (1 part coffee grounds to 4 parts brown material).
  - The composting process will break down the grounds, making the nutrients more accessible to plants.

## Important Tips
- **Avoid Overuse**: Excessive coffee grounds can compact and create a barrier, preventing water and air from reaching the roots. Always use in moderation.
- **Mix with Other Materials**: To avoid compaction and mold, mix coffee grounds with other organic matter like leaves, straw, or grass clippings when applying directly to soil.
- **Suitable Plants**: Coffee grounds are especially beneficial for acid-loving plants like blueberries, azaleas, roses, and evergreens. However, when used in moderation, they can benefit a wide range of garden plants.

## Benefits
- Improves soil structure, aiding water retention and aeration.
- Attracts earthworms, which help aerate the soil and decompose organic matter.
- Acts as a natural mulch, helping to suppress weeds.

## Potential Concerns
- **Caffeine Content**: While most caffeine is leached out during brewing, traces remain in used grounds. Some studies suggest that high levels of caffeine may inhibit plant growth. This effect is generally minimal if the grounds are composted or used sparingly.
- **Fungal Growth**: When applied too thickly or left as a solid mass, coffee grounds can encourage mold. Always apply a thin layer and mix well with soil or other organic materials.

## Summary
Used coffee grounds are a versatile, nutrient-rich organic fertilizer that can benefit many garden plants when applied correctly. Use them as a soil amendment, compost additive, or mulch, ensuring proper balance and moderation for the best results.
