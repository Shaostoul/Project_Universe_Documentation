Inventory management is a crucial gameplay mechanic that involves organizing and storing resources, equipment, and crafted items. It requires players to strategically manage their space and prioritize items based on their immediate and long-term needs.

**Storage Capacity**: Players have limited storage space, both on their character and within their ship. Expanding storage capacity through ship upgrades or specialized cargo modules allows players to carry more resources and gear, providing greater flexibility during missions.

**Resource Management**: Players must categorize and manage various resource types, including mined materials, consumables, and crafting components. Effective resource management ensures that players have the necessary materials on hand for crafting, repairs, and survival needs.

**Item Organization**: The inventory system includes features for sorting, stacking, and categorizing items to make access easier. Players can create custom categories or quick-access slots for frequently used items, streamlining gameplay and improving efficiency.

**Weight and Limitations**: Certain items have weight or volume restrictions, impacting movement speed and ship efficiency if overloaded. Players need to balance collecting resources with maintaining optimal ship performance and mobility during exploration or combat.

**Crafting Integration**: The inventory system is closely linked with crafting mechanics. Players must track and collect specific resources needed to craft new items, equipment, or upgrades, encouraging careful inventory planning and prioritization.

**Progression and Upgrades**: As players progress, they can unlock advanced storage solutions, such as automated sorting systems or specialized storage compartments for rare materials. These upgrades increase efficiency and enhance overall gameplay.
