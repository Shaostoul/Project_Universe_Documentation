# The 7 Deadly Sins

The Seven Deadly Sins, also known as the Capital Vices, represent harmful human tendencies that, when left unchecked, can lead to personal and social harm. Each sin corresponds to a vice that undermines one of the Seven Heavenly Virtues, distorting healthy desires and behaviors into destructive ones. Recognizing these tendencies and understanding their impact can help us avoid the pitfalls that hinder our well-being and relationships.

### 1. [[Envy]]
Envy is a longing for what others have, coupled with resentment toward those who possess it. This vice stirs feelings of bitterness and dissatisfaction, leading us to focus on what we lack rather than appreciating what we have. Envy is destructive because it erodes self-worth, drives unnecessary competition, and hinders supportive relationships.

### 2. [[Gluttony]]
Gluttony is the overindulgence in food, drink, or other pleasures, leading to waste and self-centeredness. It encourages excess and neglects moderation, often harming physical and mental health. Gluttony is damaging because it prioritizes fleeting satisfaction over long-term well-being, ignoring the impact of overindulgence on ourselves and our resources.

### 3. [[Greed]]
Greed is an insatiable desire for material wealth or gain, often at the expense of others. It promotes selfishness and disregard for the needs or welfare of those around us. Greed is harmful because it prioritizes possessions over people, fosters unethical behavior, and leads to dissatisfaction, regardless of what one acquires.

### 4. [[Lust]]
Lust is an excessive craving for pleasure, particularly sexual, that disregards the emotional well-being or dignity of oneself or others. It promotes objectification and impulsive gratification over meaningful connections. Lust is dangerous because it reduces individuals to mere sources of pleasure, often leading to unfulfilling relationships and emotional emptiness.

### 5. [[Pride]]
Pride is an excessive focus on oneself, often leading to arrogance and a sense of superiority. It blinds individuals to their limitations, damages relationships, and breeds resentment. Pride is dangerous because it closes us off from growth, makes us resistant to advice or help, and prevents genuine connection with others.

### 6. [[Sloth]]
Sloth is the avoidance of physical or spiritual work, resulting in stagnation and unfulfilled potential. It breeds apathy, lack of purpose, and disengagement from lifeâ€™s responsibilities. Sloth is harmful because it deprives us of achievement, weakens resilience, and prevents us from contributing meaningfully to our own growth or to society.

### 7. [[Wrath]]
Wrath is uncontrolled anger, often accompanied by a desire for vengeance. It leads to impulsive actions, destructive outbursts, and deep-seated grudges. Wrath is dangerous because it clouds judgment, escalates conflicts, and creates lasting damage to both ourselves and others, disrupting peace and understanding.
