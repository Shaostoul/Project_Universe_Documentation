# Gluttony

**Gluttony** is the excessive indulgence or consumption of food, drink, or other resources, often driven by the desire for comfort or pleasure. Rooted in a lack of self-restraint, gluttony can lead to negative physical, mental, and emotional consequences, as well as an imbalance in resource distribution and personal well-being.

### Characteristics of Gluttony

- **Overindulgence**: Gluttony involves consuming beyond what is necessary or healthy, disregarding moderation.
- **Lack of Control**: It is often marked by impulsiveness and difficulty in setting limits on consumption, whether of food, drink, or material goods.
- **Self-Centeredness**: Gluttony tends to prioritize personal pleasure over mindfulness, sometimes at the expense of others or oneâ€™s own health.
