# Vices

Vices are behaviors, tendencies, or traits that, if left unchecked, can lead to negative outcomes, both personally and in relationships with others. These qualities often arise from impulses or unmet needs and can cause harm to oneself or others if they dominate our actions. Recognizing and understanding vices is essential for personal growth, as it allows us to manage these traits and transform them into opportunities for self-awareness and improvement.
