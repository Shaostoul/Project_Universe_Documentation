# Pride

Pride is an inflated sense of self-importance and an excessive focus on personal achievements, often leading to arrogance and a lack of humility. While a certain level of pride is healthy, excessive pride can isolate individuals from others and hinder personal growth.

## Traits & Expressions

- Overemphasis on personal accomplishments
- Resistance to feedback or admitting mistakes
- Viewing oneself as superior to others
- Difficulty acknowledging others’ contributions
- Examples include bragging excessively, refusing to accept help, or looking down on others

## Influence on Self and Others

Pride can lead to strained relationships and missed opportunities for growth, as it creates distance and prevents honest self-reflection. Recognizing and tempering pride with humility can open the door to deeper connections and ongoing personal development.

## Pathways for Growth

To manage pride, practice humility by acknowledging others’ achievements and seeking feedback. Reflect on areas where you can grow and remind yourself of the value of collaboration. Embracing a mindset of continuous learning can foster a balanced, grounded perspective.
