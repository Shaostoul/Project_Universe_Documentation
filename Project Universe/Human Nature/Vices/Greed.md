# Greed

Greed is the intense desire for more wealth, power, or material possessions than one needs, often at the expense of others. This trait is marked by insatiable ambition and can lead to unethical actions and strained relationships if left unchecked.

## Traits & Expressions

- Strong desire for material wealth or control
- Prioritizing personal gain over the well-being of others
- Persistent dissatisfaction with one’s current resources
- Willingness to act unethically to achieve personal gain
- Examples include hoarding resources, pursuing profit at others’ expense, or being unwilling to share

## Influence on Self and Others

Greed creates a self-centered focus that can harm relationships and foster resentment. It often leads to stress, as one’s desires are never fully satisfied. Recognizing and managing greed can foster generosity and contentment, redirecting ambition into constructive, ethical actions.

## Pathways for Growth

To overcome greed, practice gratitude for what you have and shift focus to non-material goals. Engage in acts of generosity and consider how your actions impact others. Building a mindset of abundance and satisfaction with life’s essentials can help diminish greedy tendencies.
