# Anger

Anger is a strong feeling of displeasure or hostility, often triggered by perceived wrongs, frustrations, or injustices. While a natural emotion, unchecked anger can lead to harmful behaviors and strained relationships if it is expressed impulsively or destructively.

## Traits & Expressions

- Intense feelings of frustration or resentment
- Tendency to react impulsively when provoked
- Irritability and sensitivity to perceived slights
- Physical expressions such as clenched fists or raised voice
- Examples include shouting in frustration, lashing out at others, or harboring long-term grudges

## Influence on Self and Others

Anger, when unaddressed, can harm relationships and escalate conflicts, often leading to regretful actions. However, anger can also highlight unmet needs or personal boundaries, providing insight into areas for growth. Learning to manage anger constructively can transform it into a motivator for positive change.

## Pathways for Growth

To manage anger, practice deep breathing and pause before reacting. Reflect on the root causes of anger and address underlying needs. Techniques like mindfulness and regular self-reflection can help manage emotional responses, transforming anger into a constructive force.
