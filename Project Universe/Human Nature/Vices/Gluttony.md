# Gluttony

Gluttony is the excessive indulgence in food, drink, or other pleasures, often beyond what is necessary or healthy. This behavior reflects a lack of self-control and can lead to negative physical, mental, and emotional consequences if it becomes habitual.

## Traits & Expressions

- Overindulgence in food, drink, or other pleasures
- Difficulty controlling cravings or impulses
- Lack of moderation or restraint in consumption
- Tendency to prioritize pleasure over health or balance
- Examples include overeating regularly, excessive drinking, or constantly seeking immediate gratification

## Influence on Self and Others

Gluttony can harm physical health and mental well-being by promoting imbalance and dependency on external pleasures. It may also strain relationships if it impacts personal responsibilities or self-care. Practicing temperance and moderation can transform gluttony into a balanced approach to enjoyment.

## Pathways for Growth

To manage gluttony, practice mindfulness to become more aware of cravings and triggers. Set small, achievable goals for moderation, focusing on long-term benefits of restraint. Developing healthy habits, such as balanced eating and mindful consumption, can support a more fulfilling lifestyle.
