# Envy

Envy is the feeling of discontent or resentment that arises from comparing oneself to others and desiring their qualities, achievements, or possessions. This emotion often reflects areas of personal insecurity or unmet desires and can lead to negative thoughts and actions if it remains unaddressed.

## Traits & Expressions

- Tendency to compare oneself unfavorably to others
- Desire to possess what others have, whether material or intangible
- Self-doubt or frustration fueled by others’ accomplishments

## Influence on Self and Others

Envy can erode self-esteem and damage relationships by fostering resentment and negativity. Recognizing envy, however, can provide insights into personal goals and inspire constructive change. Transforming envy into motivation and admiration for others’ achievements encourages growth and a positive outlook.

## Pathways for Growth

To manage envy, practice gratitude and self-compassion, focusing on your own strengths and achievements. Redirect envious feelings into motivation to pursue personal goals and seek inspiration from others’ success. Reflecting on areas where you feel fulfilled can reduce the impact of envy.
