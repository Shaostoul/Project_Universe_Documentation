Rats (Rattus spp.) are highly adaptable, small mammals known for their intelligence, reproductive efficiency, and ability to thrive in a variety of environments. They are omnivorous and can survive on a diverse diet, making them successful in both urban and rural settings. Though often considered pests, they also play roles in scientific research and ecosystem dynamics.

**Data**:

- **Habitat**:
  - **Temperature**: Ideal: 18-24°C (64-75°F); Range: 0°C to 35°C (32°F to 95°F) with shelter.
  - **Pressure**: 101.3 kPa (1 atm); can adapt to variable altitudes.
  - **Humidity**: 40-70% optimal; can survive in drier or more humid environments.
  - **Oxygen**: Standard atmospheric levels (19.5-23.5%).
  - **CO2**: Tolerable up to 0.1%; higher levels can cause respiratory issues.
  - **Light**: Nocturnal vision adapted to low light; daylight tolerance with shelter.

- **Nutrition**:
  - **Water**: 15-30 ml/day.
  - **Calories**: 50-100 kcal/day depending on size and activity level.
  - **Macronutrients**: 
    - **Carbohydrates**: Grains, fruits, and plant matter.
    - **Proteins**: Insects, small animals, and plant-based sources.
    - **Fats**: From seeds, nuts, and animal sources.
  - **Vitamins**: B complex (metabolism), C (immune support).
  - **Minerals**: Calcium (bone health), Iron (oxygen transport).

- **Production**:
  - **CO2**: Approx. 0.02-0.05 kg/day.
  - **Waste**: 5-10 grams of feces/day; 10-20 ml of urine/day.
  - **Heat**: Moderate body heat; self-regulate through activity and burrowing.
  - **Sweat**: Minimal; rely on tail heat exchange for temperature regulation.

- **Reproduction**:
  - **Method**: Sexual; live birth.
  - **Gestation**: Approximately 21-24 days.
  - **Cycle**: Females come into heat every 4-5 days.
  - **Offspring**: Litters typically range from 6-12 pups.
  - **Care**: Pups are weaned around 3-4 weeks.

- **Sleep/Rest**:
  - **Cycle**: 12-15 hours/day; short intervals throughout the day and night.
  - **Active Period**: Nocturnal; most active during night hours.

- **Lifespan**: 2-3 years; longer in captivity with proper care.
- **Growth**:
  - **Maturity**: Reaches maturity around 6 weeks.
  - **Size**: Adult weight: 150-300 grams; length: 15-25 cm (excluding tail).

- **Uses**:
  - **For Humans**: Scientific research, pest control (prey for other animals).
  - **Ecosystem**: Seed dispersers, prey for predators, contribute to soil aeration.

- **Special Traits**:
  - **Adaptability**: Thrive in urban, suburban, and rural environments.
  - **Intelligence**: Capable of problem-solving, learning complex tasks.
  - **Reproductive Rate**: High reproductive efficiency; can breed year-round.
  - **Nocturnal Activity**: Active primarily at night; keen sense of smell and hearing.
  - **Burrowing Ability**: Build complex burrows for shelter and storage.
  - **Social Structure**: Often live in colonies; display social behaviors and hierarchy.
