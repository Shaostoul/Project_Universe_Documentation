Chickens (Gallus gallus domesticus) are domesticated birds raised primarily for their eggs and meat. They are highly adaptable and social animals that thrive in flocks. Chickens are omnivorous and can forage for seeds, insects, and small animals, contributing to pest control and soil health in agricultural systems.

**Data**:

- **Habitat**:
  - **Temperature**: Ideal: 18-24°C (64-75°F); Range: -10°C to 35°C (14°F to 95°F) with shelter.
  - **Pressure**: 101.3 kPa (1 atm); similar to other land birds.
  - **Humidity**: 40-60% optimal; can tolerate higher or lower levels with access to water and ventilation.
  - **Oxygen**: Standard atmospheric levels (19.5-23.5%).
  - **CO2**: Tolerable up to 0.1%; higher levels can affect respiratory health.
  - **Light**: Diurnal; require 12-16 hours of light for optimal egg production.

- **Nutrition**:
  - **Water**: 0.5-1 liter/day depending on size and weather conditions.
  - **Calories**: 100-300 kcal/day depending on size, age, and activity.
  - **Macronutrients**: 
    - **Carbohydrates**: Grains (e.g., corn, wheat) and seeds.
    - **Proteins**: Insects, worms, and commercial feed.
    - **Fats**: Found in seeds and grains; necessary for egg production.
  - **Vitamins**: A, D, E, and B complex for growth, immunity, and egg production.
  - **Minerals**: Calcium (for eggshells), Phosphorus (bone health), and Selenium (immune function).

- **Production**:
  - **CO2**: Approx. 0.2-0.4 kg/day depending on size and activity.
  - **Waste**: 100-150 grams of manure/day per bird.
  - **Heat**: Generate moderate body heat; feathers help regulate temperature.
  - **Eggs**: Lay 1 egg/day during peak laying periods; affected by light and nutrition.

- **Reproduction**:
  - **Method**: Sexual; lay fertilized or unfertilized eggs.
  - **Gestation**: Approximately 21 days for eggs to hatch.
  - **Cycle**: Can lay eggs every 24-27 hours under optimal conditions.
  - **Offspring**: Typically 10-15 chicks per clutch if brooding naturally.
  - **Care**: Hens care for chicks until they are self-sufficient (4-6 weeks).

- **Sleep/Rest**:
  - **Cycle**: Sleeps 8-10 hours/night; roosts on elevated perches.
  - **Active Period**: Diurnal; active during daylight.

- **Lifespan**: 5-10 years; production hens often have shorter lifespans.
- **Growth**:
  - **Maturity**: Reach sexual maturity around 5-6 months.
  - **Size**: Adult weight ranges from 1.5-4 kg depending on breed; height: 30-45 cm.

- **Uses**:
  - **For Humans**: Egg and meat production, pest control, and manure for fertilizer.
  - **Ecosystem**: Help control insect populations and improve soil health through foraging.

- **Special Traits**:
  - **Egg Production**: High efficiency in converting feed to eggs; light-sensitive production cycle.
  - **Social Behavior**: Live in flocks; establish social hierarchies (pecking order).
  - **Foraging Ability**: Excellent at finding seeds and insects; natural pest controllers.
  - **Adaptability**: Thrive in various environments, from free-range farms to controlled environments.
  - **Brooding**: Hens can incubate and care for eggs and chicks naturally.
  - **Vocal Communication**: Use distinct sounds to warn of predators, signal food, or communicate within the flock.
