Sheep (Ovis aries) are domesticated ruminant mammals primarily raised for wool, meat, and milk. They are social animals that thrive in flocks and are well-suited to grazing on pastures. Adaptable to various climates, sheep are an integral part of sustainable agriculture, contributing to land management and soil health.

**Data**:

- **Habitat**:
  - **Temperature**: Ideal: 10-20°C (50-68°F); Range: -20°C to 30°C (-4°F to 86°F) with proper shelter.
  - **Pressure**: 101.3 kPa (1 atm); can adapt to higher altitudes.
  - **Humidity**: 40-70% optimal; extremes (<20% or >80%) may cause stress.
  - **Oxygen**: Standard atmospheric levels (19.5-23.5%).
  - **CO2**: Tolerable up to 0.1%; higher levels can cause respiratory issues.
  - **Light**: Adapted to daylight and low-light conditions; no special UV protection needed.

- **Nutrition**:
  - **Water**: 4-6 liters/day depending on size and weather conditions.
  - **Calories**: 2,000-3,000 kcal/day based on size and activity.
  - **Macronutrients**: 
    - **Carbohydrates**: Grasses, hay, and forage plants.
    - **Proteins**: Grass and leguminous plants (e.g., clover).
    - **Fats**: Natural from forage; important for wool quality.
  - **Vitamins**: A, D, E, and B complex for growth, immune health, and wool production.
  - **Minerals**: Calcium (bones), Magnesium (metabolism), Selenium (immune function).

- **Production**:
  - **CO2**: Approx. 0.5-1 kg/day depending on size and activity.
  - **Waste**: 1-2 kg of manure/day; solid and liquid waste.
  - **Heat**: Generate moderate body heat; wool helps maintain warmth.
  - **Sweat**: Minimal; wool and respiratory heat exchange regulate temperature.

- **Reproduction**:
  - **Method**: Sexual; live birth.
  - **Gestation**: Approximately 5 months (150 days).
  - **Cycle**: Estrous cycle every 17 days; breeding season dependent on breed and location.
  - **Offspring**: Typically 1-2 lambs per birth.
  - **Care**: Lambs weaned around 8-12 weeks.

- **Sleep/Rest**:
  - **Cycle**: Sleeps 4-6 hours/day in short intervals, usually lying down.
  - **Active Period**: Diurnal; most active during daylight hours.

- **Lifespan**: 10-12 years; production sheep often have shorter lifespans.
- **Growth**:
  - **Maturity**: Reach full size at 1-2 years.
  - **Size**: Adult weight: 45-100 kg; height: 60-90 cm at the shoulder.

- **Uses**:
  - **For Humans**: Wool, meat (lamb/mutton), milk, land management.
  - **Ecosystem**: Grazers that help control vegetation and promote soil health.

- **Special Traits**:
  - **Grazing Efficiency**: Selective grazers that manage and maintain grasslands.
  - **Wool Production**: Thick wool coats provide insulation and are harvested for textiles.
  - **Social Behavior**: Flock animals; form strong social bonds and follow flock leaders.
  - **Adaptability**: Thrive in diverse environments, from mountains to pastures.
  - **Reproductive Rate**: Generally efficient breeders with 1-2 offspring per season.
  - **Calm Temperament**: Generally docile and easy to manage, making them ideal for various farming practices.
