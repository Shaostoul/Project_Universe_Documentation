Wild blueberries (Vaccinium angustifolium) are small, perennial shrubs native to North America. These hardy plants produce clusters of small, sweet, and nutritious berries. They thrive in acidic, well-drained soils and are important for wildlife as well as human consumption. Wild blueberries are valued for their antioxidant properties and are often used in culinary and medicinal applications.

**Data**:

- **Habitat**:
  - **Temperature**: Ideal: 15-25°C (59-77°F); Range: -40°C to 35°C (-40°F to 95°F) with proper winter hardiness.
  - **Pressure**: 101.3 kPa (1 atm); adapted to various altitudes.
  - **Humidity**: 50-80% optimal; drought-tolerant but benefits from regular moisture.
  - **Oxygen**: Standard atmospheric levels (19.5-23.5%).
  - **CO2**: Tolerable up to 0.1%; normal plant respiration.
  - **Light**: Full sun to partial shade; 6-8 hours of sunlight daily for optimal growth.

- **Nutrition**:
  - **Water**: 1-2 cm of water per week; requires moisture but not waterlogged soil.
  - **Soil**: Acidic soil (pH 4.0-5.5) rich in organic matter; well-draining.
  - **Nutrients**: 
    - **Nitrogen**: Essential for leaf growth.
    - **Phosphorus**: Important for root and fruit development.
    - **Potassium**: Supports overall plant health and disease resistance.
  - **Vitamins**: Produces Vitamin C and antioxidants in its berries.
  - **Minerals**: Requires Magnesium and Calcium for healthy growth.

- **Production**:
  - **CO2**: Absorbs CO2 during photosynthesis; helps regulate local carbon levels.
  - **Berries**: Produces small, sweet, blue-black berries in summer (typically July-August).
  - **Leaves**: Deciduous; green leaves turn red in autumn.
  - **Seeds**: Small seeds dispersed by birds and animals; also by natural fruit fall.

- **Reproduction**:
  - **Method**: Sexual and vegetative; spreads by seeds and rhizomes.
  - **Cycle**: Flowers in spring; berries mature in mid to late summer.
  - **Pollination**: Relies on bees and other pollinators; wind can aid seed dispersal.
  - **Offspring**: Can spread via rhizomes, forming dense patches over time.

- **Sleep/Rest**:
  - **Cycle**: Dormant during winter months; growth resumes in spring.
  - **Active Period**: Spring to late summer for flowering and fruiting.

- **Lifespan**: Perennial; individual plants can live for decades, and patches can persist for centuries.
- **Growth**:
  - **Maturity**: Berry production begins 2-3 years after planting.
  - **Size**: Typically 15-60 cm in height; dense low-growing shrubs.

- **Uses**:
  - **For Humans**: Fresh consumption, baking, jams, and medicinal use.
  - **Ecosystem**: Provides food for birds, mammals, and pollinators; stabilizes soil and promotes biodiversity.

- **Special Traits**:
  - **Cold Hardiness**: Extremely resistant to freezing temperatures; survives harsh winters.
  - **Antioxidants**: Berries contain high levels of anthocyanins, beneficial for health.
  - **Rhizomatic Growth**: Spreads via underground rhizomes, forming extensive patches.
  - **Pollinator Attraction**: Flowers attract bees, promoting cross-pollination.
  - **Soil Adaptability**: Thrives in nutrient-poor, acidic soils unsuitable for many other plants.
  - **Longevity**: Perennial nature allows it to endure and expand for generations.
