Here is a list of common **soil amendments** that can be used to improve soil structure, fertility, and overall plant health:

### **1. Organic Matter**
   - **Compost**: Decomposed organic material rich in nutrients and beneficial microbes. Improves soil structure, moisture retention, and fertility.
   - **Manure**: Animal waste (e.g., cow, chicken, horse) that is composted to reduce pathogens. It adds nitrogen, phosphorus, and organic matter to the soil.
   - **Green Manure**: Plants (e.g., clover, rye) grown specifically to be turned back into the soil, providing organic matter and nutrients.
   - **Leaf Mold**: Decomposed leaves that improve soil structure and moisture retention.
   - **Worm Castings**: Excrement from earthworms, rich in nutrients and beneficial microbes. Enhances soil structure and fertility.

### **2. Minerals**
   - **Lime (Calcium Carbonate)**: Raises soil pH and adds calcium, improving soil structure and helping nutrient uptake.
   - **Gypsum**: Adds calcium and sulfur without affecting pH, improving soil structure, especially in compacted clay soils.
   - **Epsom Salt (Magnesium Sulfate)**: Provides magnesium and sulfur, important for photosynthesis and plant growth.
   - **Rock Phosphate**: A natural source of phosphorus that is slowly released into the soil, aiding root and flower development.
   - **Greensand**: Contains potassium, iron, and other trace minerals; improves soil fertility and structure, especially in sandy soils.
   - **Azomite**: A mineral product containing trace elements and micronutrients that enhance soil fertility.

### **3. Animal Byproducts**
   - **Bone Meal**: Ground animal bones, rich in phosphorus and calcium; promotes root growth and flowering.
   - **Blood Meal**: Dried animal blood that provides a high nitrogen content; boosts leafy growth.
   - **Feather Meal**: High-nitrogen product made from poultry feathers; provides a slow-release nitrogen source.
   - **Fish Emulsion**: A liquid fertilizer derived from fish waste, rich in nitrogen and other nutrients.

### **4. Organic Mulches**
   - **Straw**: Used as a mulch to retain moisture, suppress weeds, and add organic matter as it decomposes.
   - **Wood Chips**: Provide long-lasting mulch that decomposes slowly, adding organic matter and improving soil structure.
   - **Cocoa Shell Mulch**: Adds organic matter and nutrients while providing a natural, attractive mulch for gardens.
   - **Pine Needles**: Acidic mulch suitable for acid-loving plants; decomposes slowly and improves soil structure.

### **5. Soil Conditioners**
   - **Peat Moss**: Retains moisture and improves soil structure; acidic, so itâ€™s ideal for acid-loving plants. Note: Use sparingly due to sustainability concerns.
   - **Coconut Coir**: A sustainable alternative to peat moss; improves moisture retention and aeration.
   - **Perlite**: A lightweight, volcanic rock that aerates the soil, improving drainage and preventing compaction.
   - **Vermiculite**: A mineral that expands when heated, helping soil retain moisture and nutrients while improving aeration.

### **6. Biochar**
   - **Biochar**: Charred organic material that enhances soil fertility, retains nutrients, and supports beneficial microorganisms. It also sequesters carbon, contributing to soil sustainability.

### **7. Alfalfa Meal**
   - Made from dried alfalfa plants, this amendment provides nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium, as well as trace minerals and growth hormones that promote plant development.

### **8. Kelp Meal and Seaweed Extract**
   - **Kelp Meal**: Dried seaweed that contains a wide range of micronutrients and trace elements beneficial for plant growth. 
   - **Seaweed Extract**: A liquid concentrate that enhances plant growth, improves soil structure, and boosts resilience to stress.

### **9. Agricultural Sulfur**
   - Lowers soil pH for acid-loving plants (e.g., blueberries, azaleas) and provides sulfur, an essential nutrient for plant growth.

### **10. Humic and Fulvic Acids**
   - Organic compounds derived from decaying plant matter; they enhance nutrient availability and stimulate root growth.

### **11. Zeolite**
   - A natural mineral that improves soil aeration, retains nutrients, and enhances moisture retention in sandy soils.

### **12. Dolomitic Lime**
   - Contains both calcium and magnesium, ideal for raising soil pH and supplying essential nutrients.

### **13. Sand**
   - Improves drainage in heavy clay soils, enhancing aeration and preventing waterlogging.

### **14. Sphagnum Moss**
   - Used primarily for soil aeration and moisture retention, especially in potting mixes for orchids and other plants that require high humidity.

### **15. Rice Hulls**
   - Lightweight and sustainable amendment that improves soil aeration and drainage, making it suitable for raised beds and potting mixes.

These soil amendments, when used correctly, can improve soil fertility, structure, and overall plant health. The choice of amendment depends on the specific needs of the soil and the plants being cultivated.
