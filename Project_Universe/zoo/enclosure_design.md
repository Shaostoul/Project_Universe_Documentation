# Enclosure Design

## Real-World Perspective
Enclosure design is a critical aspect of zoo management, focusing on creating safe, enriching, and functional habitats for animals. A well-designed enclosure meets the physical, psychological, and social needs of the species while also considering the safety and educational experience of visitors.

### Key Principles
- **Natural Mimicry**: Enclosures should replicate the animals’ natural habitats, including appropriate vegetation, terrain, and water features.
- **Safety**: Barriers must protect animals and visitors while ensuring the animals cannot escape or harm themselves.
- **Enrichment**: The space should include features that encourage natural behaviors, such as climbing structures, digging areas, and hiding spots.
- **Accessibility**: Enclosures should allow zookeepers to safely feed, clean, and care for the animals with minimal stress to the occupants.

### Examples of Effective Design
- **Savannah Exhibit**: Large open spaces with mixed species, waterholes, and shaded areas.
- **Rainforest Aviary**: Multi-level habitats with dense vegetation, streams, and perching areas.
- **Aquatic Tanks**: Clear, temperature-controlled water with dynamic features like currents and hiding zones.

### Challenges
- Balancing the animals’ needs with visitor viewing experiences.
- Adapting designs for animals with unique or complex requirements.
- Managing costs while meeting regulatory and welfare standards.

## In-Game Implementation
In the game, enclosure design is an interactive system where players can create, customize, and upgrade habitats for their animals. This system emphasizes creativity, strategy, and education, allowing players to understand the complexities of designing animal enclosures.

### Gameplay Features
- **Habitat Tools**:
  - Terrain sculpting for hills, ponds, and other natural features.
  - Placement of vegetation, rocks, and enrichment items.
- **Animal Needs**:
  - Each species has specific requirements, such as space, temperature, and social group size.
  - Indicators help players identify if the enclosure meets these needs.
- **Customization**:
  - Players can select themes (e.g., desert, rainforest, tundra) for enclosures.
  - Decorative elements enhance visual appeal and visitor engagement.

### Progression and Challenges
- **Unlockable Features**:
  - Advanced barriers, enrichment options, and climate control systems.
  - Larger or mixed-species enclosures with more complex needs.
- **Dynamic Environments**:
  - Weather effects impact enclosure conditions (e.g., rain fills waterholes, snow requires heating systems).
  - Animals may alter their enclosures over time, requiring players to adapt.
- **Maintenance**:
  - Enclosures require regular cleaning, repairs, and adjustments to maintain animal welfare.

### Educational Objectives
- Teach players the principles of enclosure design, such as balancing animal needs and visitor access.
- Emphasize the importance of enrichment and natural behaviors in animal welfare.
- Encourage sustainable and innovative design approaches.

Enclosure design in the game combines creativity with strategic management, giving players the tools to craft habitats that are both functional and engaging.```
