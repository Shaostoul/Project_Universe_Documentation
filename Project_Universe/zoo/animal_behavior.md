# Animal Behavior

## Real-World Perspective
Animal behavior encompasses the actions and interactions of animals with their environment, other animals, and humans. Observing and understanding behavior is essential for ensuring the welfare and health of animals, whether in the wild or captivity. Key aspects include:

### Types of Behavior
- **Instinctive**: Innate behaviors like mating, foraging, and territorial defense.
- **Learned**: Behaviors acquired through experience, such as using tools or adapting to human environments.
- **Social**: Interactions within groups, such as hierarchy establishment and cooperative activities.

### Importance of Behavior
- **Health Indicators**: Changes in behavior can signal illness, stress, or injury.
- **Enrichment Needs**: Providing mental and physical challenges helps prevent boredom and stress.
- **Conservation Efforts**: Understanding behavior aids in reintroduction programs and habitat management.

### Behavioral Enrichment
- **Physical Objects**: Toys, puzzles, or climbing structures.
- **Sensory Stimuli**: Scents, sounds, or visual elements to mimic the wild.
- **Feeding Strategies**: Hiding food or creating challenges to stimulate natural foraging.

## In-Game Implementation
In the game, animal behavior is simulated to provide an engaging and educational experience while contributing to gameplay depth. Players interact with animals by observing, managing, and influencing their behaviors. Key mechanics include:

### Types of Behavior
- **Instinctive**: Automated routines for basic needs like eating, sleeping, and roaming.
- **Learned**: Animals can develop new behaviors based on player actions, such as responding to training or using provided tools.
- **Social**: Animals form groups, establish hierarchies, and interact dynamically based on species traits.

### Gameplay Features
- **Behavioral Indicators**: Visual and audio cues to signal health, stress, or happiness.
- **Behavioral Enrichment**:
  - Players can place items like toys or climbing structures to enrich animal lives.
  - Enrichment items improve animal happiness and reduce negative behaviors.
- **Observation Tasks**:
  - Players are rewarded for observing and recording specific behaviors.
  - Observation contributes to skill progression and unlocks new features.

### Advanced Mechanics
- **AI-Driven Dynamics**: Animals adapt to changing environments, such as new enclosures or social group changes.
- **Behavior-Based Challenges**: Players must manage aggressive animals, stressed individuals, or disrupted social hierarchies.
- **Training Systems**:
  - Use positive reinforcement to teach animals behaviors for care and display.
  - Unlock rewards by improving animal welfare and enhancing visitor engagement.

### Educational Objectives
- Teach players real-world behavioral principles.
- Emphasize the importance of enrichment, habitat design, and welfare in animal management.
