# Training

Teaching animals behaviors for care and enrichment helps ensure their safety and welfare. Training techniques focus on positive reinforcement to encourage voluntary participation in medical procedures, feeding, and enrichment activities. This strengthens the bond between animals and caretakers while improving welfare.
