# Automation

## Real-World Perspective
Automation in zoos is increasingly used to streamline animal care, improve welfare, and optimize resource management. By integrating technology, zookeepers can focus more on meaningful interactions and monitoring while routine tasks are handled automatically. Key aspects include:

### Types of Automation
- **Feeding Systems**: Timed dispensers for consistent nutrition delivery.
- **Environmental Controls**: Automated temperature, humidity, and lighting systems tailored to specific species.
- **Monitoring Systems**: Sensors and cameras to track animal activity, health, and habitat conditions.

### Benefits of Automation
- **Consistency**: Ensures animals receive timely and accurate care, reducing human error.
- **Efficiency**: Saves time and effort on repetitive tasks like feeding and cleaning.
- **Data Collection**: Provides real-time information for better decision-making in health and welfare management.

### Challenges
- **Cost**: Initial investment can be high, especially for advanced systems.
- **Adaptation**: Animals may take time to adjust to automated systems.
- **Maintenance**: Regular upkeep is required to ensure system reliability.

## In-Game Implementation
Zoo automation in the game is designed to enhance player experience by offering tools and systems to manage routine tasks efficiently. This allows players to focus on strategic decisions and creative aspects of zoo management. Key mechanics include:

### Types of Automation
- **Feeding Systems**:
  - Players can install automated feeders with customizable schedules.
  - Feeders require periodic refilling and maintenance.
- **Environmental Controls**:
  - Set temperature, humidity, and lighting for each enclosure.
  - Advanced systems automatically adapt to weather or animal needs.
- **Monitoring Systems**:
  - Sensors provide real-time data on animal health, activity, and habitat conditions.
  - Alerts notify players of issues like low food levels, health problems, or environmental imbalances.

### Gameplay Features
- **Unlockable Upgrades**:
  - Players can research and install more efficient or specialized automation systems as they progress.
  - Advanced upgrades reduce maintenance needs or increase system efficiency.
- **Resource Management**:
  - Automation systems consume energy and resources, requiring players to balance efficiency and costs.
- **Customization Options**:
  - Players can fine-tune automation settings, such as feeding frequencies or environmental adjustments, to match animal needs.

### Advanced Mechanics
- **AI Integration**:
  - Systems adapt to animal behaviors, adjusting settings dynamically (e.g., reducing feeding frequency during hibernation).
- **Enrichment Automation**:
  - Timed dispensers for toys or sensory stimuli keep animals engaged without manual intervention.
- **Failure States**:
  - Systems can fail due to power shortages, wear and tear, or incorrect settings, adding challenge and realism.

### Educational Objectives
- Demonstrate the importance of consistency and precision in animal care.
- Highlight the potential and limitations of technology in real-world zoo management.
- Encourage players to think critically about the balance between automation and human oversight.
