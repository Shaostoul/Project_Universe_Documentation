# Dependence

Dependence is a reliance on substances, activities, or people for emotional or physical well-being. While some forms of dependence are necessary (like mutual reliance in relationships), excessive dependence can limit personal growth and autonomy.

## Traits & Expressions

- Relying on a substance, person, or activity for comfort or stability
- Difficulty functioning independently or without the dependent element
- Withdrawal symptoms or distress when access is restricted
- Feelings of insecurity or helplessness without support

## Influence on Self and Others

Dependence can strain relationships, limit personal growth, and create obstacles to self-sufficiency. Recognizing dependence allows for building healthy coping mechanisms, fostering resilience and independence.

## Pathways for Growth

To address dependence, practice self-awareness to recognize reliance patterns. Gradually increase self-reliance by setting small goals, building support networks, and seeking professional guidance if needed.
