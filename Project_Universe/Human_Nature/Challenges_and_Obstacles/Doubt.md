# Doubt

Doubt is a feeling of uncertainty or lack of confidence in oneself, others, or circumstances. While doubt can inspire caution, excessive doubt can prevent progress and lead to self-sabotage if not kept in check.

## Traits & Expressions

- Hesitation and second-guessing decisions
- Reluctance to take action or make commitments
- Insecurity in oneâ€™s abilities or judgment
- Tendency to seek constant reassurance

## Influence on Self and Others

Doubt can erode self-confidence and lead to missed opportunities, straining relationships if it creates a lack of trust. Recognizing doubt and seeking clarity can transform uncertainty into cautious but effective decision-making.

## Pathways for Growth

To manage doubt, practice self-reflection and focus on evidence of past successes. Build confidence through small accomplishments and seek support from trusted individuals for balanced feedback.
