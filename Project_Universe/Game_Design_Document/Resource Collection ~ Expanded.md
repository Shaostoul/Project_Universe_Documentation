# **Resource Collection: Expanded**

1. **Farming**:
    * **Plant Selection:** Players choose specific plants based on nutritional needs and crafting requirements.
    * **Growth Monitoring:** Regular check-ups and care of the crops. Interaction with water, light, and nutrient systems.
    * **Pest & Disease Control:** Managing potential threats to crops and employing preventive measures.

2. **Mining**:
    * **Asteroid Mining with Drones**:
        - **Manual Operation**: Players can pilot drone craft, choosing where to mine on the asteroid, and managing drone energy and storage capacity.
        - **Automated Drones**: Set drones on automated mining routes. Players would need to manage drone maintenance, upgrade paths, and analyze collected data for best results.
        - **Asteroid Analysis**: Before mining, players may need to analyze asteroids for valuable resources. This can involve scanning technologies and decision-making about which asteroids to prioritize.

    * **Planetary Mining (for future development)**:
        - This will extend the existing mining mechanics but will introduce planetary conditions like gravity, atmospheric challenges, and potentially alien flora/fauna interactions.

3. **Scavenging**:
    * **Onboard Scavenging**:
        - **Resource Management**: Over time, resources and tools may become unused or obsolete. Players can decide to repurpose these items, recycle them, or trade them.
        - **Decommissioned Sections**: As the ship evolves or suffers damages, some sections might be abandoned. These can become scavenging hotspots.

    * **Alien Craft Expeditions**:
        - **Reconnaissance**: Players need to initially scout the alien craft, determining potential threats and valuable zones.
        - **Expedition Teams**: Players can form teams to venture into alien craft, introducing co-op gameplay elements.
        - **Reverse Engineering**: Once alien technology is brought back, players need to invest time in understanding and adapting the tech for their use.
        - **Hazards**: Alien crafts might have traps, automated defenses, or remnants of its original crew. This introduces combat or avoidance gameplay elements.

    * **Scientific Analysis**:
        - **Lab Work**: After scavenging, players may need to analyze materials in onboard labs, introducing mini-games or tasks related to material identification and usage discovery.
        - **Research Trees**: Alien materials might unlock new research avenues, allowing for unique upgrades and tools.
