SLA (Stereolithography) uses a laser or projector to cure liquid resin layer by layer into solid plastic. Each layer is selectively hardened by UV light, creating highly detailed models with smooth finishes.

- **Materials**:
  - **Resins**: Includes **Standard** (basic resin), **Tough** (for strength), **Flexible** (rubber-like), **High-Temp** (heat-resistant), and **Biocompatible** (medical uses).
  - **Specialty Resins**: Includes **Dental** and **Jewelry** resins designed for specific applications needing precision and detail.

- **Printer Components**:
  - **Resin Tank**: Holds liquid resin during printing, with a transparent bottom for UV light to pass through.
  - **Build Platform**: Platform where the model is created, typically lifting out of the resin as layers are added.
  - **UV Laser/Projector**: Cures resin to form each layer, with precision down to microns for high-detail prints.

- **Advantages**:
  - **High Detail**: SLA produces very fine details and smooth surfaces, ideal for miniatures, jewelry, and dental models.
  - **Smooth Finish**: Layer lines are almost invisible due to the curing process, reducing the need for sanding.
  - **Flexible Material Options**: Specialized resins offer tailored mechanical properties for various applications.

- **Limitations**:
  - **Post-Processing**: Requires cleaning and curing of printed parts, typically with isopropyl alcohol (IPA) and UV light.
  - **Resin Handling**: Liquid resin can be toxic and requires careful handling and storage.
  - **Cost**: Generally more expensive than FDM, with higher resin costs and more complex maintenance.

- **Applications**:
  - **High-Detail Prototyping**: Ideal for detailed prototypes, medical models, and engineering parts.
  - **Jewelry and Dental Models**: Used in creating precise molds and forms in jewelry-making and dental fields.
  - **Miniatures and Figurines**: Popular in industries requiring intricate detailing, such as model-making and gaming.

- **Printing Tips**:
  - **Orientation**: Angling parts slightly on the build plate can reduce suction forces and prevent failed prints.
  - **Supports**: Use custom supports in slicing software for optimal strength and minimal contact points.
  - **Resin Maintenance**: Regularly filter and store resin to prevent cured particles from affecting print quality.

SLA printing excels in producing high-resolution, smooth parts ideal for precision applications. While requiring careful handling and post-processing, its ability to produce complex and delicate designs makes it indispensable in fields demanding high-quality visual results.
