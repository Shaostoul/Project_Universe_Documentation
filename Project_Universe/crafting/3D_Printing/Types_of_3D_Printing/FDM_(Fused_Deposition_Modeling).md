FDM (Fused Deposition Modeling) is a popular 3D printing technology that builds objects layer by layer by melting and extruding thermoplastic filament through a heated nozzle. Each layer is deposited onto the previous one, creating a solid 3D model.

- **Materials**: 
  - Commonly used filaments include **PLA**, **ABS**, **PETG**, **TPU** (flexible), and **Nylon**. 
  - Specialty filaments like **carbon fiber-infused**, **wood-fill**, and **metal-fill** are also available for enhanced properties.

- **Printer Components**: 
  - **Extruder**: Feeds filament into the **hot end**, where it is melted.
  - **Hot End/Nozzle**: Heats and extrudes melted filament to form each layer.
  - **Print Bed**: Surface where the model is built, typically heated to help with adhesion and minimize warping.
  - **Stepper Motors**: Control the X, Y, and Z-axis movements for precise positioning.

- **Advantages**:
  - **Affordability**: FDM printers are relatively affordable and widely available, making them accessible to hobbyists and professionals.
  - **Material Versatility**: Compatible with various filaments, allowing for different mechanical properties.
  - **Low Post-Processing**: Usually requires minimal post-processing beyond removing support structures.

- **Limitations**:
  - **Layer Visibility**: The layer-by-layer process may create visible layer lines, affecting surface finish.
  - **Strength**: FDM parts are generally weaker along the Z-axis (layer direction) due to the bonding between layers.
  - **Print Speed**: Often slower than other methods like SLA for high-detail or large prints.

- **Applications**:
  - **Prototyping**: Quick and affordable method for functional prototypes.
  - **End-Use Parts**: Used for producing custom parts, housings, and tools.
  - **Educational**: Widely used in educational settings for teaching engineering, design, and manufacturing.

- **Printing Tips**:
  - **Adhesion**: Use a heated bed, adhesive solutions (e.g., glue stick), or textured bed surfaces to help with bed adhesion.
  - **Layer Height**: Adjust layer height for detail vs. speed (smaller layers for detail, larger for faster prints).
  - **Cooling**: Set cooling fan speed based on materialâ€”higher cooling for PLA, low or off for ABS to reduce warping. 

FDM remains the most widely used 3D printing technology for its balance between cost, versatility, and ease of use.
