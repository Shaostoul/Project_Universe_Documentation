Metal filaments are composites, combining powdered metal with a plastic binder (typically PLA or other thermoplastic) to allow FDM printers to produce objects with the look, feel, and some properties of metal. These filaments are available in materials like copper, bronze, stainless steel, and iron, making them ideal for decorative and functional applications that mimic metal without requiring full metal 3D printing equipment.

- **Properties**: Heavier than standard filaments, metallic look and feel, potentially abrasive on extruders, less flexibility than pure thermoplastics.
- **Best For**: Decorative objects, low-wear metal-like parts, artistic prints, prototypes that simulate metal.

- **Toxicity and Food Safety**:
  - **During Manufacturing**: Manufacturing generally involves handling fine metal powders, which can be hazardous if inhaled; these materials are usually safe when combined in filament form.
  - **During Printing**: Low fumes but the potential for microscopic metal particles, especially in poorly ventilated areas. Ensure adequate ventilation.
  - **Post-Printing**: Not food-safe, as the metal composite materials may leach and are difficult to sanitize.
  - **Recyclability**: Not recyclable in conventional plastic or metal recycling processes; should be disposed of according to composite material guidelines.

- **Advantages**:
  - **Metal-Like Aesthetic and Weight**: Produces heavier, more durable prints that closely resemble actual metal.
  - **Polishing and Patina**: Prints can be polished, sanded, or left to develop a patina for added authenticity.
  - **Increased Rigidity**: Greater stiffness than standard PLA due to metal content, though not as strong as pure metal.

- **Limitations**:
  - **Abrasive on Nozzles**: Can quickly wear out brass nozzles; a hardened steel nozzle is recommended.
  - **Higher Print Temperatures**: Requires higher temperatures than regular PLA, depending on the metal and binder used.
  - **Post-Processing Requirements**: Often needs sanding, polishing, or chemical treatments to achieve the desired metallic finish.
  - **Increased Fragility**: Due to the metal powder, parts may be more brittle compared to regular PLA.

- **Print Settings**:
  - **Nozzle Type**: Hardened steel or ruby nozzle recommended due to abrasiveness.
  - **Layer Height**: 0.1–0.2 mm
  - **Extrusion Temperature**: Typically 200–250°C, depending on the binder
  - **Bed Temperature**: 50–60°C, or as required by the filament

- **Applications**:
  - **Decorative Items**: Jewelry, sculptures, and display pieces that mimic actual metal.
  - **Prototyping**: Simulates metal parts for prototyping or visual representations.
  - **Functional Parts**: Low-stress components or props that benefit from the metal's look and feel.
  - **Artistic Models**: Ideal for models that benefit from polishing or weathering effects.

- **Post-Processing**:
  - **Sanding and Polishing**: Achieves a metallic shine with sanding and buffing.
  - **Chemical Patina**: Copper and bronze filaments can develop a patina when treated with specific chemicals.
  - **Smoothing**: Light sanding can smooth surfaces; avoid excessive heat, as it may cause the PLA binder to deform.

Metal filaments bridge the gap between plastic and metal, providing a cost-effective way to create metal-like objects with FDM printers. While they lack the strength of real metal, they allow for visually striking and authentic-feeling results with the right equipment and post-processing techniques.
