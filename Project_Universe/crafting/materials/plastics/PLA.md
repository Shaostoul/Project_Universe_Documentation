PLA (PolyLactic Acid) is a popular, plant-based filament made from renewable resources like cornstarch or sugarcane, making it environmentally friendly and compostable under industrial conditions. It is the most commonly used 3D printing material, known for its ease of use, relatively low cost, and wide color availability.

- **Properties**: Biodegradable, low-warp, low odor, easy to print, comes in a wide range of colors.
- **Best For**: Prototyping, aesthetic models, low-stress applications, educational projects.

- **Toxicity and Food Safety**:
  - **During Manufacturing**: PLA’s production is relatively eco-friendly, involving natural, renewable sources, which limits the environmental impact and exposure to toxic chemicals compared to petroleum-based plastics.
  - **During Printing**: PLA emits minimal volatile organic compounds (VOCs) compared to filaments like ABS. The emissions are considered low-toxicity, but using a well-ventilated area or air purifier is advisable.
  - **Post-Printing**: PLA is generally safe to handle and produces low toxicity, although additives (such as colorants and plasticizers) may alter its safety slightly. PLA is sometimes marketed as food-safe, but **food safety depends on the manufacturer’s certifications** and whether the printer’s hotend is food-safe. Additionally, PLA is porous, which can trap bacteria, so it’s not ideal for long-term or reusable food contact without a food-safe coating.
  - **Heat Resistance and Food Contact**: PLA’s low heat resistance (~60°C) makes it unsuitable for hot foods or washing in hot water. If certified as food-safe and printed on an appropriate setup, PLA can be suitable for temporary, cold food contact items like cookie cutters or serving trays. However, it should be used with caution and not for extended food contact due to its porosity.

- **Advantages**:
  - **Easy to Print**: Low warping and shrinkage make PLA ideal for beginners and those without heated print beds.
  - **Smooth Finish**: Produces smooth, high-quality surfaces with vibrant color options.
  - **Eco-Friendly**: Biodegradable in industrial composting facilities, making it more sustainable than petroleum-based plastics.
  - **Low Odor**: Emits a mild, sweet smell during printing, unlike other filaments with stronger, sometimes unpleasant odors.

- **Limitations**:
  - **Low Heat Resistance**: PLA softens at lower temperatures (~60°C/140°F), making it unsuitable for high-heat or outdoor applications.
  - **Brittle**: More prone to snapping than other filaments like ABS or PETG, limiting its use in functional parts under stress.
  - **Limited Durability**: PLA can degrade over time when exposed to sunlight and moisture, affecting its longevity.

- **Print Settings**:
  - **Extruder Temperature**: 180–220°C
  - **Bed Temperature**: 0–60°C (heated bed not required but can improve adhesion)
  - **Print Speed**: 30–70 mm/s
  - **Cooling**: Use active cooling for better print quality and layer adhesion

- **Applications**:
  - **Prototyping and Concept Models**: Ideal for creating quick prototypes to test form and fit.
  - **Decorative Items**: Great for printing figurines, models, and other low-stress, visually focused items.
  - **Educational Projects**: Safe and easy to print with, making it suitable for classroom and beginner projects.
  - **Medical Uses**: In some cases, PLA is used for low-cost, biodegradable medical models and tools.

- **Post-Processing**:
  - **Sanding and Painting**: Easy to sand and paint for aesthetic finishes.
  - **Annealing**: To improve heat resistance, PLA can be annealed by heating in an oven (~80°C) for a short period, though this can cause shrinkage and warping.

PLA is a versatile, eco-friendly filament suited to a wide range of 3D printing applications, particularly where durability and high-heat tolerance are not required. While PLA is relatively non-toxic, users should be cautious with food applications, as most PLA filaments do not undergo specific food-safety certifications, and bacteria buildup can occur on its porous surface.
