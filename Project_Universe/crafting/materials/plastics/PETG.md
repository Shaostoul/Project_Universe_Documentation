PETG (PolyEthylene Terephthalate Glycol) is a popular 3D printing filament known for its balance between durability, flexibility, and ease of use. It combines some of the best properties of PLA (easy to print) and ABS (impact-resistant), making it a versatile option for functional parts. PETG has low warping, is resistant to moisture, and offers food-safe varieties, though printing conditions and additives should be considered for food safety.

- **Properties**: Strong, flexible, impact-resistant, moisture-resistant.
- **Best For**: Functional parts, food containers, mechanical components, and applications needing chemical resistance.

- **Toxicity and Food Safety**:
  - **During Manufacturing**: PETG production is similar to PET (used in beverage bottles), and generally produces less environmental impact than other filaments. It is also recyclable in some systems.
  - **During Printing**: PETG emits fewer fumes than ABS and is considered safer to print indoors. However, it’s recommended to have ventilation as VOCs may still be present, especially at higher temperatures.
  - **Post-Printing**: Some PETG brands are FDA-approved for food contact; however, use caution as high temperatures and additives during printing may affect food safety. Avoid prolonged or repeated contact with food unless specifically certified.
  - **Recyclability**: PETG is recyclable and can be processed similarly to PET, but is less widely accepted in typical consumer recycling systems.

- **Advantages**:
  - **Low Warping**: PETG has low shrinkage and is less prone to warping than ABS, making it easier to print.
  - **Chemical and Moisture Resistance**: Resistant to water, most chemicals, and UV exposure, which makes it suitable for outdoor or humid environments.
  - **Durable and Flexible**: Offers a good balance of flexibility and strength, especially compared to more brittle PLA.
  - **Transparency**: Available in transparent options, making it ideal for parts where clarity is preferred.

- **Limitations**:
  - **Adhesion to Nozzle**: PETG can be sticky, sometimes stringing or adhering to the nozzle, which may require adjustments in retraction settings.
  - **Lower Heat Resistance than ABS**: PETG is more heat-resistant than PLA but less so than ABS, limiting its applications in high-heat environments.
  - **Prone to Stringing**: PETG tends to string if retraction settings are not carefully calibrated.

- **Print Settings**:
  - **Extruder Temperature**: 220–250°C
  - **Bed Temperature**: 70–80°C
  - **Print Speed**: 30–60 mm/s
  - **Cooling**: Moderate cooling recommended to reduce stringing without compromising layer adhesion.

- **Applications**:
  - **Food Containers**: (When using food-safe PETG) Ideal for water bottles and food containers, offering better resistance to damage than PLA.
  - **Mechanical Parts**: Suitable for gears, clips, and other functional parts that require moderate flexibility and impact resistance.
  - **Outdoor Parts**: Durable and UV-resistant, making it suitable for outdoor enclosures and signs.

- **Post-Processing**:
  - **Sanding**: PETG can be sanded, but careful handling is required due to its flexibility.
  - **Polishing**: PETG does not respond well to acetone but can be polished with flame or mechanical polishers.

PETG is a versatile, durable filament ideal for functional parts and moderate outdoor use. It’s easier to print than ABS, resistant to moisture and UV exposure, and food-safe varieties exist, though caution is advised for consistent food use.
