TPU (ThermoPlastic Polyurethane) is a flexible, rubber-like filament known for its durability and elasticity. This filament is ideal for parts requiring flexibility, impact resistance, or shock absorption, such as phone cases, gaskets, or wheels. Although TPU can be challenging to print due to its elasticity, it offers excellent mechanical properties and is resistant to abrasion and chemicals.

- **Properties**: Highly flexible, impact-resistant, chemical-resistant, durable.
- **Best For**: Flexible parts like phone cases, seals, gaskets, grips, wearables, and wheels.

- **Toxicity and Food Safety**:
  - **During Manufacturing**: TPU is generally non-toxic and safe to handle, though production may involve additives that affect flexibility and durability.
  - **During Printing**: Emits minimal fumes, though ventilation is still recommended. TPU is less hazardous than ABS but should still be used with caution in enclosed spaces due to potential VOCs.
  - **Post-Printing**: Not typically food-safe and may not be suitable for prolonged skin contact unless specified by the manufacturer. It can degrade under high temperatures or chemical exposure, affecting safety.
  - **Recyclability**: TPU can be recycled but is less commonly accepted in consumer recycling systems. Check with local facilities for recyclability options.

- **Advantages**:
  - **Flexibility and Elasticity**: TPU’s elasticity allows it to bend and return to shape, ideal for parts that need to stretch or compress.
  - **Durable and Abrasion-Resistant**: Resistant to wear, making it suitable for high-friction applications.
  - **Chemical and Oil Resistance**: Offers protection against oils, greases, and some chemicals, expanding its usage in industrial settings.
  - **Shock Absorption**: TPU’s flexibility allows it to absorb shocks, making it suitable for protective parts.

- **Limitations**:
  - **Printing Difficulty**: TPU’s flexibility can cause issues with filament feeding, requiring precise settings and slower speeds.
  - **Lower Heat Resistance**: Softens at lower temperatures than some rigid plastics, limiting its use in high-heat applications.
  - **Less Dimensional Accuracy**: Can warp or shrink more easily, affecting print accuracy.

- **Print Settings**:
  - **Extruder Temperature**: 210–230°C
  - **Bed Temperature**: 0–60°C (may not require a heated bed)
  - **Print Speed**: 15–30 mm/s (slow speed is crucial to avoid clogging)
  - **Cooling**: Moderate cooling is recommended to improve print quality without affecting adhesion.

- **Applications**:
  - **Wearables**: Ideal for wristbands, custom-fit parts, and other items in contact with skin due to comfort and flexibility.
  - **Protective Cases**: Commonly used for phone and tablet cases, offering drop protection and flexibility.
  - **Automotive Parts**: Used in vibration-dampening mounts, bushings, or seals.
  - **Robotic Parts**: Excellent for wheels, tires, and other movable parts needing grip or impact resistance.

- **Post-Processing**:
  - **Sanding**: TPU can be lightly sanded for finishing, though care is needed due to flexibility.
  - **Painting**: Can be painted with flexible coatings if desired.

TPU offers unique applications where flexibility and durability are critical. Although it requires careful handling during printing, TPU is highly valuable for wearables, protective parts, and industrial applications needing abrasion resistance, making it a versatile option in 3D printing.
