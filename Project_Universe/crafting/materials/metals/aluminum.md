# Aluminum

Aluminum is a lightweight, durable, and highly versatile metal widely used in construction, manufacturing, and various engineering applications. Its corrosion resistance, recyclability, and efficient primary production process make it an essential material in modern industries. The production process involves mining bauxite, refining it into alumina, smelting it into aluminum metal, and finally casting it into usable forms.

## Characteristics
- Lightweight: 
  - Density of approximately 2.7 g/cm³, about one-third the weight of steel.
- Corrosion Resistant: 
  - Forms a natural oxide layer that protects against rust and environmental degradation.
- High Strength-to-Weight Ratio: 
  - Tensile strength ranges from 70 to 700 MPa depending on the alloy.
- Conductivity: 
  - Electrical conductivity is about 37.7 million siemens per meter (MS/m), roughly 61% of copper's conductivity.
- Recyclable: 
  - 100% recyclable without significant property loss, requiring only 5% of the energy to recycle compared to primary production.
