# Steel

Steel is a strong, durable, and highly versatile alloy widely used in construction, manufacturing, and various engineering applications. Its strength, toughness, and flexibility make it a cornerstone material in modern industries. The production process involves refining iron ore, removing impurities, adding alloying elements, and casting it into usable forms.

## Assets
- TBD

## Characteristics
- High Strength: 
  - Tensile strength ranges from 250 to 2000 MPa depending on the grade and treatment.
- Corrosion Resistance (Stainless Steels): 
  - Contains at least 10.5% chromium, which forms a passive layer to resist rust.
- Toughness: 
  - Absorbs energy during deformation, making it resilient in dynamic environments.
- Machinability: 
  - Can be shaped, welded, and machined with appropriate tools.
- Magnetic Properties: 
  - Certain types (e.g., carbon steels) are magnetic, while others (e.g., austenitic stainless steels) are not.

## Common Alloys
  - **Carbon Steel**: 
    - High carbon content improves hardness and strength but reduces ductility.
    - Typical composition: 0.05% to 2.0% carbon.
  - **Stainless Steel**: 
    - Resistant to corrosion due to chromium content (at least 10.5%).
    - Common grades include 304 (18% chromium, 8% nickel) and 316 (18% chromium, 10% nickel, 2% molybdenum).
  - **Alloy Steel**: 
    - Contains elements like manganese, silicon, nickel, and vanadium for enhanced properties.
    - Common applications include tools, machinery, and automotive parts.
  - **Tool Steel**: 
    - High hardness and resistance to wear; used for cutting tools and molds.
    - Typical composition: High carbon with elements like tungsten or molybdenum.
  - **Spring Steel**: 
    - High yield strength, allowing it to return to shape after deformation.
    - Commonly contains silicon and manganese.

## Primary Production
1. **Mining Iron Ore**:
   - **Input**: Iron ore (hematite or magnetite).
   - **Output**: Raw iron ore.
   - **Process**: Mining and crushing the ore into manageable pieces.
   - **Energy**: Minimal; heavy equipment or manual extraction.
   - **Byproducts**: Overburden material (waste rock).

2. **Refining Iron**:
   - **Input**: Iron ore + Coke (carbon) + Limestone.
   - **Output**: Pig iron.
   - **Process**: Blast furnace smelting at ~2000°C.
   - **Energy**: ~14 GJ per ton of pig iron.
   - **Byproducts**: Slag (can be used in construction).
   - **Waste**: Minimal; slag is often recycled.

3. **Converting to Steel**:
   - **Input**: Pig iron + Oxygen (via Basic Oxygen Furnace) or Electric Arc Furnace.
   - **Output**: Molten steel.
   - **Process**: Oxygen injection removes carbon and impurities.
   - **Energy**: ~2–4 GJ per ton for basic oxygen; ~400 kWh per ton for electric arc.
   - **Byproducts**: Carbon dioxide emissions.
   - **Waste**: Scale and slag; both can be recycled.

4. **Alloying and Casting**:
   - **Input**: Molten steel + Alloying elements (e.g., chromium, nickel).
   - **Output**: Steel billets, plates, or coils.
   - **Process**: Continuous casting or ingot molds.
   - **Energy**: Low; primarily for maintaining molten state.
   - **Byproducts**: Minimal; dross (oxidized impurities).
