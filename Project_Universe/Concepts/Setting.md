The game is set in humanity's future following our first fleet of interstellar colony spacecraft on a mission to explore and colonize our galaxy. Players are ordinary crew members in charge of providing a life for themselves contained within their own biodome located somewhere within their homeship. Homeships are large spacecraft designed to indefinitely survive in the space between stars where resources are incredibly scarce. *Assuming the fleet is traveling at light speed the nearest star [Alpha Centauri](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_Centauri) is roughly a 4 year trip from Earth, so we must make the most of what little resources and space we do have.*

By developing a "homesteads in interstellar space" game we pseudo-justifiably have to design the most efficient closed loop self-sustaining homesteads possible. The added benefit of this is we're simultaneously designing incredible homesteads able to be built here on Earth. While there are different rules that need to be followed for designing real-life homesteads in space (such as zero gravity), we're developing a game, so the homesteads we do design don't technically have to follow real-life reality's rules. We want to help people on Ea  rth first, because there are deadly food shortages affecting millions across the globe. We can't give everyone the money and other resources they need to end their poverty, but we can develop tools they can use to help themselves.
