Mining is a primary gameplay mechanic that involves extracting resources from asteroids and other space objects. It is essential for gathering the materials needed for crafting, upgrading equipment, and trading, forming the backbone of the resource economy.

**Mining Equipment**: Players use specialized tools and equipment, such as mining lasers or drones, to extract resources. These tools can be upgraded for efficiency, increased yield, or enhanced range, allowing players to mine more effectively as they progress.

**Resource Identification**: Scanning systems help players identify valuable resource nodes within asteroid fields. Players must choose which asteroids to mine based on their composition and value, encouraging strategic decision-making and exploration.

**Automation with AI Drones**: Players can deploy AI mining drones to automate the resource extraction process. Drones work independently or under player direction, increasing resource collection efficiency and allowing players to focus on other tasks simultaneously.

**Environmental Hazards**: Mining carries risks, as asteroids may contain volatile materials or be located in dangerous areas. Players need to manage these hazards, such as protecting their ship from debris or defending against hostile entities during mining operations.

**Resource Management**: Players must manage the storage and transport of mined materials back to their ship. Inventory limitations and cargo capacity require careful planning to maximize resource yield while avoiding overloading and maintaining mobility.

**Story Integration**: Mining often plays a role in missions, requiring players to gather specific resources to complete objectives, build new equipment, or unlock new areas. Successful mining operations are crucial for advancing the storyline and enhancing the player's capabilities.
