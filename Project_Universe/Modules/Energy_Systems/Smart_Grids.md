Smart grids are modernized electrical grids that incorporate digital technology to monitor, manage, and optimize the generation, distribution, and consumption of electricity. By using sensors, communication networks, and automation, smart grids enable real-time data exchange between power providers, consumers, and grid operators. This enhances energy efficiency, improves reliability, supports renewable energy integration, and empowers consumers to manage their own energy use.
