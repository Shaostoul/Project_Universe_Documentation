### Key Takeaways with Lifetime Production Insights

1. **Nuclear**: With high lifetime energy output (320,000-480,000 GWh), nuclear offers sustained power but requires intensive waste management and safety protocols.
2. **Solar**: Although individual panels generate modest energy annually (~1.5 MWh), their 25-30 year lifespan means scalable, sustainable production (up to 45 MWh).
3. **Wind**: Onshore turbines deliver consistent energy (~6 MWh/year) and accumulate ~120-150 MWh over 20-25 years, though location and intermittency issues remain.
4. **Geothermal**: Limited by location, but with a long operational life (30-50 years), geothermal plants produce between 12,000 and 20,000 GWh, making it reliable in the right settings.
5. **Hydroelectric**: With exceptional efficiency (80-90%) and a lifespan of up to 100 years, large hydro projects can deliver 100,000-200,000 TWh, albeit with significant environmental trade-offs.
6. **Fossil Fuels**: While highly productive (up to 200,000 GWh over 30-40 years), fossil fuels face challenges from emissions, resource extraction, and non-renewability.
7. **Biomass**: Versatile yet low efficiency, biomass can be sustainable but is resource-intensive and less productive long-term compared to other renewables.
8. **EMF Harvesting**: This low-output, low-maintenance method is innovative but only feasible for powering small devices, not large-scale energy needs.

This comparison shows why a blend of energy sources is crucial. Balancing high-output, long-lasting systems like nuclear and hydro with scalable renewables like solar and wind creates a resilient energy network that adapts to both immediate demands and sustainable, long-term needs.
