This note outlines the structure and formulas needed to develop a two-tiered energy system in Unreal Engine 5, where players manage personal energy consumption and interact with a community energy grid. The goal is to balance home-based self-sufficiency and community resource-sharing, encouraging progression from energy reliance to independence.

### Key Components:
1. **Home-Based Energy System** - Player-controlled small-scale power generation and consumption.
2. **Public Energy Grid** - Large-scale, community-managed energy production.

## System Components

### 1. **Home-Based Energy System (Player-Centric)**

#### Key Mechanics:
- **Energy Generation**: Small generators (e.g., solar panels, wind turbines, bioenergy units) produce energy (measured in kWh).
- **Energy Storage**: Players can add storage options like batteries. Stored energy is drawn on cloudy days, low wind, or peak usage periods.
- **Energy Consumption**: Consumption includes lighting, tools, appliances, etc., and varies based on activity.

#### Basic Formulas:
- **Energy Produced (kWh)**:
   $$E_{prod} = \sum_{i=1}^n (Gen_{i} \times Eff_{i} \times \Delta t)$$
   where:
   - $Gen_{i}$: Generation capacity of energy source ($i$) (e.g., solar, wind).
   - $Eff_{i}$: Efficiency of generator ($i$) (accounts for losses).
   - $\Delta t$: Time increment.

- **Energy Debt (kWh)**:
   $$E_{debt} = E_{consumed} - E_{stored} - E_{prod}$$
   If $E_{debt} > 0$, the player relies on the public grid; if $E_{debt} \leq 0$, they are self-sufficient or contributing.

#### Unreal 5 Tips:
   - Use *Blueprints* for individual generators and storage units, enabling modular upgrades.
   - Track each player's energy status with *Data Tables* for easy UI integration.
   - Utilize *Timeline* nodes for real-time energy updates, showing production vs. consumption.

### 2. **Public Energy Grid (Community-Based)**

#### Key Mechanics:
- **Large-Scale Generators**: Nuclear, hydro, or fusion reactors power shared systems, built through community resource contributions.
- **Energy Pool**: Tracks the energy generated by public resources minus the collective consumption by all players.
- **Energy Debt Contribution System**: Players track personal energy debts and contribute to communal grid resources to repay or even become net contributors.

#### Basic Formulas:
- **Total Community Energy Pool (kWh)**:
   $$E_{pool} = \sum_{j=1}^m (Gen_{j} \times Eff_{j} \times \Delta t) - \sum_{k=1}^p (Cons_{k})$$
   where:
   - $Gen_{j}$: Generation capacity of large generators $j$.
   - $Eff_{j}$: Efficiency of generator $j$.
   - $Cons_{k}$: Consumption of player $k$.
   - $E_{pool}$: Updated per tick, allowing real-time adjustments.

- **Debt Repayment Calculation**:
   $$
   Debt_{repay} = E_{contrib} - E_{debt}
   $$
   where:
   - $E_{contrib}$: Energy or resource value contributed to the grid.
   - $E_{debt}$: Player’s personal energy debt.
   - If $Debt_{repay} > 0$, the player contributes surplus energy.

#### Unreal 5 Tips:
   - Track community grid data using a *Game Instance* for global state management.
   - Use *RPCs* (Remote Procedure Calls) to handle player contributions, ensuring synchronized data in multiplayer.
   - Display public energy pool stats on a communal UI using *UMG Widgets*, updated by a central energy manager.

## Implementation Guide

1. **Create Generators and Storage Units**
   - **Blueprints** for small generators (solar, wind, bioenergy) with adjustable output based on efficiency.
   - **Batteries** as storage with charge/discharge rates affecting how long energy is available during low production.

2. **Develop Personal Energy Meters**
   - Use *Data Tables* for each player’s energy generation, consumption, and storage.
   - **Meter Logic**: Update player debt status in real-time and show surplus or deficit.

3. **Set up the Public Energy Grid**
   - Central energy pool managed by *Game Instance*.
   - Calculate total energy generated by communal resources and player consumption each tick.
   - Display community energy levels and public energy debt on communal UI accessible by all players.

4. **Debt Repayment and Contribution Tracking**
   - Players gain points or community rewards as they pay back energy debt.
   - Contributions recorded in player stats, enabling tracking of net providers or consumers.

5. **UI and Visualization**
   - Player Dashboard: Personal generation and debt levels.
   - Communal Dashboard: Shows public energy pool and collective status.
   - Use color indicators (e.g., green for surplus, red for deficit) to show energy health at a glance.

6. **Testing and Balancing**
   - Regularly test generation, consumption, and debt formulas to ensure that players reach self-sufficiency at a reasonable rate.
   - Use *Gameplay Tags* for tracking different energy sources and adjust efficiency per environment or player upgrades.

## Additional Considerations

- **Future Upgrades**: As players gain resources, they can contribute to new community projects (e.g., more efficient reactors).
- **Emergencies and Events**: Power outages, reactor issues, or energy surges can add unexpected challenges.
- **Player Achievements**: Reward players for achieving self-sufficiency or becoming net contributors to the public grid.
