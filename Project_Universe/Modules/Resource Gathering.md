Resource gathering is a core gameplay mechanic, essential for crafting, upgrading, and survival. Players collect various materials from asteroids, space debris, and other environments, which are then processed and utilized for building, trading, and progression.

**Mining and Harvesting**: Players extract resources primarily through mining asteroids and gathering materials from space debris. Specialized tools like mining lasers, drills, and drones are used for efficient resource extraction, and these tools can be upgraded to increase yield and efficiency.

**Diverse Resource Types**: Resources range from common minerals and metals to rare elements and exotic compounds. Players must explore different environments to find and collect specific resources needed for crafting advanced equipment or upgrading their ship.

**Scavenging and Exploration**: Players may find valuable items by scavenging wreckage, abandoned space stations, or derelict ships. Scanning technology helps locate these resources, and exploration plays a crucial role in discovering new sources of rare materials.

**AI Assistance**: AI drones and companion units can be deployed to automate resource gathering. Players can assign AI to mine asteroids or collect debris, allowing efficient multitasking and freeing up the player to focus on other activities, such as exploration or combat.

**Inventory and Management**: Players must manage storage and transport for gathered resources, balancing cargo capacity with the need to collect diverse materials. Efficient resource management is crucial for maximizing the effectiveness of gathering operations and optimizing gameplay.

**Integration with Progression**: Collected resources are used for crafting, upgrading systems, and completing missions. Successful resource gathering enables progression by providing the materials needed for technology advancements, ship improvements, and unlocking new gameplay features.
