| **Factor**                | **Description**                                                                                          |
|---------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Soil Quality**          | Composition, pH, drainage, nutrient levels (e.g., N-P-K), organic matter, and structure for root health. |
| **Water Availability**    | Frequency and amount of water required based on plant needs and growth stage, including irrigation methods.|
| **Light Exposure**        | Sunlight duration and intensity required for photosynthesis, varies by plant type (full sun, partial shade).|
| **Temperature Range**     | Ideal temperature range for growth, germination, flowering, and fruiting stages.                         |
| **Humidity Levels**       | Relative humidity requirements for optimal growth; too high or low can cause disease or stress.          |
| **Nutrient Management**   | Fertilization plans tailored to plant needs, including macro and micronutrients.                         |
| **Plant Spacing**         | Recommended distance between plants to avoid competition and ensure airflow and sunlight penetration.    |
| **Pest and Disease Control** | Common pests and diseases, along with prevention methods (e.g., crop rotation, natural predators, and pesticides).|
| **Growth Cycle**          | Total lifespan and stages (e.g., seedling, vegetative, flowering, and harvest) for timing care.          |
| **Pollination Needs**     | Self-pollinating, insect-pollinated, or wind-pollinated; additional support may be needed.               |
| **Pruning Requirements**  | Frequency and type of pruning necessary for growth control, air circulation, and yield improvement.      |
| **Harvest Timing**        | Optimal time to harvest based on maturity indicators for quality and yield.                             |
| **Crop Rotation**         | Schedule of crop rotation to manage soil fertility, prevent pest cycles, and reduce disease risk.       |
| **Climate Suitability**   | Adaptability of plants to local climate conditions (e.g., frost tolerance, drought resistance).         |
| **Mulching**              | Use of mulch to retain moisture, regulate temperature, and suppress weeds.                             |
| **Weed Management**       | Techniques to control weed growth that competes with crops for nutrients, water, and light.             |
| **Seasonal Requirements** | Planting and harvest seasons for timing based on climate and specific plant growth requirements.        |
| **Seed Quality**          | High-quality, disease-free seeds ensure healthier growth and higher yields.                            |
| **Labor Needs**           | Amount and type of labor for planting, tending, and harvesting crops.                                   |
| **Equipment and Tools**   | Machinery, tools, and infrastructure needed for planting, maintenance, and harvesting.                  |
| **Post-Harvest Processing** | Steps to clean, store, and possibly process crops for quality preservation and marketability.          |
| **Market Demand**         | Availability of buyers or use cases for the crops to ensure sustainable income or purpose for the yield. |
