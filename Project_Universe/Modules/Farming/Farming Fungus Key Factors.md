| **Factor**                  | **Description**                                                                                          |
|-----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Substrate Composition**   | Type and quality of substrate (e.g., hardwood sawdust, straw, or enriched substrates) needed for growth. |
| **Substrate Sterilization** | Ensuring the substrate is sterilized or pasteurized to prevent contamination from competing organisms.    |
| **Humidity Levels**         | High humidity (usually 80-95%) is required for fruiting, especially during pinning and growth stages.    |
| **Temperature Range**       | Ideal temperature for each stage: incubation (e.g., 21-24°C / 70-75°F) and fruiting (16-18°C / 60-65°F).|
| **Light Exposure**          | Limited light is usually needed; indirect light or low-intensity light supports the fruiting stage.      |
| **Air Exchange**            | Good air exchange is essential to prevent CO₂ buildup, which can hinder mushroom growth.                 |
| **pH Range**                | Substrate pH levels should generally be slightly acidic, around 5.5 to 6.5 for optimal growth.           |
| **Inoculation Method**      | Method for introducing spores or mycelium, often via grain spawn or liquid culture.                      |
| **Moisture Content**        | Consistent moisture level in the substrate, usually around 50-60%, to support mycelium colonization.     |
| **Colonization Time**       | Length of time for the mycelium to colonize the substrate before fruiting can begin (e.g., 2-3 weeks).   |
| **Fruiting Conditions**     | Adjustments in light, temperature, and humidity to encourage fruiting body formation after colonization. |
| **Contaminant Prevention**  | Strict hygiene practices and tools to prevent contamination from bacteria, molds, and other fungi.       |
| **Growth Cycle**            | Lifecycle from inoculation, incubation, colonization, to fruiting and harvest.                          |
| **Ventilation**             | Consistent, gentle airflow needed to reduce CO₂ levels without drying out the growing environment.      |
| **Pruning/Harvesting**      | Technique for harvesting fruiting bodies without damaging the substrate, which can allow further growth. |
| **Species-Specific Needs**  | Unique requirements for different types of mushrooms, e.g., lion’s mane prefers hardwood substrates.    |
| **Nutrient Amendments**     | Adding supplements like bran or gypsum to the substrate to boost growth and yield.                      |
| **Seasonal Suitability**    | Optimal growing seasons or indoor environmental controls for year-round production.                     |
| **Inoculation Density**     | Amount of spawn used per substrate volume to ensure rapid colonization and reduce contamination risk.   |
| **Contaminant Detection**   | Monitoring for signs of contamination (e.g., unusual colors or smells) and isolating affected areas.    |
| **Yield Potential**         | Typical yield per substrate volume, varies by species and growing conditions (e.g., 1 lb per 5 lbs substrate). |
| **Labor Needs**             | Manual effort required for substrate preparation, inoculation, and ongoing monitoring.                  |
| **Growth Cycle Time**       | Estimated time from inoculation to harvest, often 4-8 weeks depending on species and conditions.        |
| **Climate Control**         | Adjustments in a controlled indoor environment to maintain ideal conditions for each stage.             |
| **Harvest Timing**          | Timing for harvest to ensure optimal quality and yield, often when fruiting bodies are fully developed. |
| **Market Demand**           | Consumer demand for specific mushroom varieties to ensure sustainable income or purpose for the yield.   |
