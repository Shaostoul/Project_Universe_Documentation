ABS is a robust, heat-resistant, and slightly flexible filament commonly used for industrial and engineering applications. Known for its strength and durability, ABS is well-suited to functional parts but requires a heated bed and an enclosed environment to reduce warping during printing.

- **Properties**: Strong, impact-resistant, durable, heat-resistant.
- **Best For**: Mechanical parts, automotive components, enclosures, and parts requiring high impact resistance.

- **Toxicity and Food Safety**:
  - **During Manufacturing**: ABS production involves petrochemicals, which can be environmentally taxing. Proper disposal and recycling of ABS are essential to reduce environmental impact.
  - **During Printing**: ABS emits high levels of VOCs and fumes, including styrene, which can be irritating or harmful when inhaled. It is strongly advised to print ABS in a well-ventilated area, preferably with an enclosure and ventilation system.
  - **Post-Printing**: ABS is generally not food-safe due to the presence of potentially harmful chemicals. Its porous nature also makes it harder to sterilize, so it should not be used in food-contact applications unless specifically certified.
  - **Recyclability**: ABS can be recycled, but it is less commonly accepted in consumer recycling systems compared to PET or PLA.

- **Advantages**:
  - **Heat Resistance**: ABS can withstand high temperatures, making it suitable for parts exposed to moderate heat.
  - **Durability**: Excellent impact resistance, making it ideal for functional and load-bearing parts.
  - **Smooth Finish**: ABS can be post-processed with acetone for a smooth, glossy surface.
  - **Flexibility**: Compared to other filaments like PLA, ABS has some flexibility, which helps prevent it from cracking under stress.

- **Limitations**:
  - **Warping**: ABS is highly prone to warping, requiring a heated bed (90–110°C) and preferably an enclosed chamber.
  - **Fumes**: Emits toxic fumes during printing, necessitating ventilation.
  - **Not Biodegradable**: ABS is derived from petrochemicals and is not biodegradable, raising environmental concerns if not recycled properly.

- **Print Settings**:
  - **Extruder Temperature**: 220–250°C
  - **Bed Temperature**: 90–110°C
  - **Print Speed**: 30–60 mm/s
  - **Cooling**: Minimal to none, as rapid cooling can lead to warping

- **Applications**:
  - **Automotive Parts**: Commonly used for dashboards, fenders, and other car components due to its impact and heat resistance.
  - **Household Appliances**: Often used in enclosures for small electronics and other devices.
  - **Prototyping**: Durable enough for rapid prototyping of functional parts in engineering and design.

- **Post-Processing**:
  - **Sanding and Polishing**: ABS sands well and can be polished to a smooth finish.
  - **Acetone Vapor Smoothing**: ABS can be smoothed with acetone vapors for a glossy, polished finish.

ABS is a strong, impact-resistant filament ideal for engineering and functional parts but requires proper handling due to its toxicity and tendency to warp. It is suitable for parts that need durability and heat resistance but is not recommended for food-contact applications.
