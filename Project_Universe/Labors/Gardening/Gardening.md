Here's a detailed list of everything to track for optimal plant growth and utilization in Project Universe, considering both Earth and space environments:

### Plant Growth Tracking

1. **Plant Genetics**  
   - Species, variety, and genetic traits for resilience, yield, or specific qualities.
   
2. **Environmental Conditions**  
   - **Light**: Type (sunlight, LED spectrum), duration, intensity, and cycles.
   - **Temperature**: Optimal range, daily/night fluctuations, and tolerance levels.
   - **Humidity**: Required range, adaptability, and impact on growth and disease resistance.
   - **Atmospheric Composition**: Oxygen, COâ‚‚, and any additional gases.
   - **Soil/Medium Composition**: Type, nutrient content, pH, and microbial ecosystem.
   - **Water**: Frequency, quantity, quality (pH, mineral content), and source.

3. **Growth Phases**  
   - Seed germination requirements, root establishment, vegetative growth, flowering/fruiting, and harvesting conditions.

4. **Nutrition and Fertilization**  
   - Type of nutrients (NPK levels, micronutrients), frequency, quantity, and method of delivery (soil, hydroponic solution, foliar feeding).

5. **Pest and Disease Management**  
   - Monitoring for pests, symptoms of disease, treatment/prevention methods, and immune response tracking.

6. **Pollination Requirements**  
   - Type of pollination (self, insect, wind), needs for external pollinators, or artificial pollination mechanisms.

7. **Growth Monitoring**  
   - Height, leaf size, root spread, growth rate, fruit/flower development, and signs of stress or nutrient deficiencies.

8. **Resource Consumption**  
   - Daily/seasonal water, nutrient, and light energy usage for optimization in a resource-limited environment.

9. **Soil/Medium Rejuvenation**  
   - Process to restore soil/medium health after each growth cycle for sustainable planting.

### Production and Harvesting

10. **Harvest Timing and Methods**  
    - Optimal timing based on plant maturity, nutrient density, and desired end-use characteristics.

11. **Yield Quality and Quantity**  
    - Weight, nutrient profile, flavor, and physical characteristics of produce.

12. **Post-Harvest Processing**  
    - Cleaning, drying, sorting, and quality control methods for plant-based materials.

### Uses and Transformation

13. **Primary Uses**  
    - **Edibles**: Fresh produce, dried goods, oils, herbal extracts, etc.
    - **Materials**: Fibers for textiles, wood for construction, oils for fuels.
    - **Medicinal**: Herbal applications, essential oils, medicinal extracts.

14. **Secondary Processing and Byproducts**  
    - **Building Materials**: Bioplastics, composite panels, structural beams, natural fibers.
    - **Clothing and Textiles**: Fabric weaving, fiber strengthening treatments, dyeing.
    - **Energy Production**: Biofuels, composting, or biomass fuel for energy sources.
    - **Nutrient Recycling**: Composting and mulching leftover plant parts to replenish soil nutrients.

15. **Waste Management**  
    - Methods for recycling unused plant parts or byproducts to reduce waste and enhance sustainability.
