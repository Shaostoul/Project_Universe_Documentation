# Soil Rejuvenation

## Overview
Soil and growth mediums lose fertility over time as plants absorb nutrients, making rejuvenation necessary to maintain soil health. In environments like space or hydroponics, rejuvenation ensures continuous crop productivity.

## Rejuvenation Methods

1. **Composting and Organic Matter**  
   - Adding compost or organic waste replenishes nutrients and improves soil structure, increasing its capacity to retain water and support microbial life.

2. **Nutrient Supplements**  
   - Replacing depleted nutrients (especially N, P, and K) through fertilizers or nutrient solutions restores soil fertility for the next growth cycle.

3. **Crop Rotation and Cover Crops**  
   - Alternating crop types or planting cover crops prevents nutrient depletion and reduces soil-borne disease buildup, supporting long-term soil health.

4. **Sterilization (Controlled Environments)**  
   - Sterilizing the soil or medium in closed systems (e.g., hydroponics) helps prevent disease and ensures a healthy starting point for new crops.

## Practical Application in Gameplay

1. **Soil Health Meter**  
   - Introduce a soil health metric that decreases with each growth cycle, requiring players to rejuvenate soil for sustained productivity.

2. **Rejuvenation Options**  
   - Provide various rejuvenation options (e.g., adding compost, applying fertilizer) that players can choose based on available resources and soil condition.

3. **Long-Term Effects**  
   - Implement consequences for neglecting soil health, such as decreased yield over time or vulnerability to disease, encouraging proactive soil management.
