## Types of Secondary Processing

1. **Textiles**  
   - Fibers from plants like cotton or hemp can be processed into textiles for clothing or fabrics, adding value to basic crops.

2. **Bioplastics and Fuel**  
   - Organic materials can be converted into bioplastics or biofuels, creating sustainable alternatives to traditional plastics and fuels.

3. **Oils and Extracts**  
   - Essential oils, medicinal extracts, or food-grade oils can be derived from specific plants, offering additional functionality.
