# Waste Management

## Overview
Waste management in agriculture involves reusing or disposing of plant byproducts and unused materials. Effective waste management reduces environmental impact, promotes sustainability, and in resource-limited environments, maximizes utility.

## Types of Waste Management

1. **Composting**  
   - Decomposing organic material into nutrient-rich compost, which can then be used to replenish soil health.

2. **Recycling and Repurposing**  
   - Turning plant waste into alternative products, like converting stalks into fibers or seeds into biofuel, reducing landfill waste.

3. **Biodegradable Disposal**  
   - In cases where reuse isn't possible, ensuring waste decomposes naturally without harming the environment.

## Practical Application in Gameplay

1. **Waste Conversion Options**  
   - Offer players choices in managing waste, like composting for soil health or converting to energy, adding value to byproducts.

2. **Efficiency Tracking**  
   - Implement a waste efficiency metric, rewarding players for reducing waste and maximizing resource reuse.

3. **Environmental Impact Simulation**  
   - Show consequences of poor waste management, like soil depletion or pollution, to emphasize sustainable practices.
