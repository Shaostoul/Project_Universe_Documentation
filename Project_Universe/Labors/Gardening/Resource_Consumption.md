# Resource Consumption

## Overview
Plants require water, nutrients, light, and space, and their resource consumption varies by species, growth phase, and environmental conditions. Managing resources is essential to sustain plant health, especially in limited or closed ecosystems.

## Key Resource Requirements

1. **Water**  
   - Frequency and quantity depend on plant type and environmental conditions. Over- or under-watering can cause stress, impacting growth and yield.

2. **Nutrients**  
   - Macro (N, P, K) and micronutrients must be balanced to meet specific plant needs at different growth stages. Consumption rates may peak during active growth.

3. **Light and Energy**  
   - Photosynthesis requires light; plants vary in their ideal light intensity and duration, influencing overall growth speed and resource demand.

4. **Space**  
   - Crowded conditions limit root and leaf expansion, affecting plant size and health. Resource competition can reduce growth rates and yield.

## Practical Application in Gameplay

1. **Resource Tracking**  
   - Display resource usage metrics to allow players to manage and allocate resources effectively, balancing needs with availability.

2. **Resource Efficiency Upgrades**  
   - Offer options for players to optimize resource usage through upgrades (e.g., energy-efficient lights or drip irrigation) for improved resource management.

3. **Impact of Resource Limitations**  
   - Introduce consequences for resource shortages, such as slower growth or reduced yield, to emphasize the importance of efficient resource allocation.
