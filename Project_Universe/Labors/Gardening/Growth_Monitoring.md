# Growth Monitoring

## Overview
Growth monitoring involves tracking plant development through various metrics, including height, leaf size, and root expansion. Monitoring allows for early detection of issues, making adjustments to optimize plant health and yield.

## Key Metrics to Track

1. **Height and Spread**  
   - Regular measurements of plant height, width, and leaf spread to assess overall growth progress and ensure enough space for development.

2. **Leaf and Root Health**  
   - Observing leaf color, size, and texture can indicate nutrient levels or environmental stress. Root monitoring (if accessible) helps assess water and nutrient uptake.

3. **Flower and Fruit Formation**  
   - Tracking the emergence of flowers and fruits is essential for timing pollination and fertilization, and determining when plants are ready for harvest.

## Practical Application in Gameplay

1. **Growth Stages Tracking**  
   - Enable players to view plant metrics visually or through data readouts, encouraging proactive care and optimization.

2. **Warning Indicators**  
   - Display alerts when growth metrics indicate potential issues, such as nutrient deficiency or pest infestations, to allow for early intervention.

3. **Growth Rate Adjustment**  
   - Players can experiment with growth conditions to maximize plant size or yield, adjusting environmental factors based on growth feedback.
