# Post-Harvest Processing

## Overview
Post-harvest processing involves steps taken to prepare crops for storage, transport, or consumption, preserving freshness and quality. Processing can enhance product lifespan, flavor, and value, especially important in controlled environments where food must be stored efficiently.

## Primary Processing Methods

1. **Cleaning and Sorting**  
   - Removing dirt, debris, or pests and categorizing crops by size and quality to ensure consistency in storage and consumption.

2. **Drying and Curing**  
   - Reducing moisture to prevent spoilage; drying is especially useful for long-term storage in space or remote environments.

3. **Cooling and Refrigeration**  
   - Lowering temperatures immediately after harvest slows spoilage, preserving freshness and nutrient content.

## Practical Application in Gameplay

1. **Processing Options**  
   - Offer players choices in post-harvest processing methods, each with trade-offs in shelf-life, quality, and resource cost.

2. **Storage Quality Effects**  
   - Processed crops should have variable quality based on the method used, affecting in-game value or nutrition when consumed.

3. **Automation Upgrades**  
   - Provide players with automated processing options that require initial investment but enhance efficiency, especially for large-scale operations.
