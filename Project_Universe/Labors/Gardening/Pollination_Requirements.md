# Pollination Requirements

## Overview
Pollination is essential for plants to produce seeds and fruits, ensuring reproduction and crop yield. Pollination requirements vary by species and can be natural (wind, insects) or artificial (manual pollination in controlled environments). In space or isolated habitats, artificial methods are often necessary due to a lack of natural pollinators.

## Types of Pollination

1. **Self-Pollination**  
   - Occurs when pollen from a flower fertilizes itself or another flower on the same plant. Self-pollinating plants are generally more adaptable to isolated environments and require minimal intervention.

2. **Cross-Pollination**  
   - Requires pollen transfer between flowers on different plants. Cross-pollinated plants often rely on pollinators like bees or wind. This type of pollination typically increases genetic diversity and plant resilience.

3. **Artificial Pollination**  
   - In controlled environments, manual methods like brushing or vibrating plants can simulate pollination. This method is crucial in space or closed habitats where natural pollinators are absent.

## Practical Application in Gameplay

1. **Pollinator Simulation**  
   - Allow players to manage virtual pollinators or use tools to manually pollinate crops, simulating realistic methods and adding depth to plant care.

2. **Pollination Efficiency**  
   - Implement varying success rates based on method; cross-pollinated plants might yield more if properly managed, while self-pollinators are easier but may offer smaller yields.

3. **Controlled Environment Pollination**  
   - Enable players to select artificial pollination methods in enclosed spaces to ensure plant reproduction, offering gameplay choices for efficient seed and fruit production.
