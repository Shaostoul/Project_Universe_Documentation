By submitting assets to Shaostoul and Project Universe, you agree to the following terms:

If your contribution is considered a code asset:

- You and your contribution adhere strictly to the license of the project being contributed to. This (potentially) includes but is not limited to:
    - AGPL 3.0
    - MIT
    - CC BY-NC-SA 3.0
    - BSL 1.1

If your contribution is considered a creative asset:

- You agree to give Shaostoul and Project Universe permission to redistribute the submitted asset in source and compiled form under the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International Public License (More details [here](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/legalcode))
- Â You agree to give Shaostoul and Project Universe permission to redistribute the submitted asset in compiled form for commercial purposes.

Creative assets include, but are not limited to:

- 2D drawn art
- 3D models
- Textures for 3D models
- 3D animation
- Music

Reasoning:

- Code assets should follow the license of the project. This is standard practice in open source development.
- Creative assets require two permissions:
    - Redistribution in source and compiled forms under CC-BY-SA-NC. This carries a few key clauses:
        - The creator of the asset is to be directly credited.
        - Derivatives must be shared under the same license.
        - No commercial use of the asset without explicit permission.
    - Project Universe may be in the future be considered donationware, which falls under the commercial use clauses under the CC-BY-SA-NC.
