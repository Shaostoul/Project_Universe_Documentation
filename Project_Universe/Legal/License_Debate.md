We're discussing which license best fits our community and Project Universe. If you or anyone you know is voluntarily willing to help us figure this out, please get in [contact](https://shaostoul.com/contact/) with us!

Currently we're considering three options:

1. The Business Source License 1.1 (BSL 1.1) similarly used by [MariaDB](https://mariadb.com/bsl11/) and [Couchbase](https://www.couchbase.com/blog/couchbase-adopts-bsl-license/). This is not a true "open source" license per the definition of the [Open Source Initiative](https://opensource.org/) (OSI), it's a "source available" license.
2. The GNU Affero General Public License ([AGPL 3.0](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.en.html)) is a true open source license, but we can't prevent anyone from taking Project Universe's source, making their own game, then selling it. It does however ensure if they modify the source they must inform users of the changes they made.
3. The Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial Share-Alike ([CC BY-NC-SA 3.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/)) license is a non-open-source license due to the NC-SA bit. It would most likely be used in a dual-licensing situation where the code uses the AGPL license while the artwork, sounds, etc. are protected under the CC license.

I'm in the process of seeking aid from the [American Bar Association](https://www.americanbar.org/groups/legal_services/flh-home/flh-free-legal-help/), but have yet to hear back from them.

As an educational platform and providing tools helping everyone achieve self-sustainability via homesteading, we want to ensure our tools are always and forever freely accessible and modifiable by you. We believe anything meant to help humanity should be free and open source, but we also want to protect ourselves and you from potential lawsuits and malicious parties who'd modify then distribute/serve our product to you and possibly install malware, steal information, or anything else.

With your help we'll find the perfect fit for us, but it will take time. Thank you for your time, patience, and support during these early stages of development!
