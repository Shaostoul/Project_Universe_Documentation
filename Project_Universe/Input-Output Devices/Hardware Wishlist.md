# Headphones

If I'm to replace the crappy headphones I currently barely use, these are my top 2 choices:

## $4,999 [Focal Utopia 2022 Open-back Circumaural Headphones](https://www.sweetwater.com/store/detail/Utopia--focal-utopia-2022-open-back-circumaural-headphones)

I have two 6x9" Focal speakers in my 1975 Chevy Nova, their sound quality is top notch! Focal headphones have gotta be mindblowing!

## $173 [Sennheiser HD 25 PLUS On Ear Closed Back Monitoring DJ Headphones](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01CT3WD9Q/ref=twister_B09C1BN6LL)
Being made for DJs and sound engineers makes it a good choice for me as a game developer.
