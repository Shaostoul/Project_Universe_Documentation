  - **Planters**: Ideal for urban or space environments.
  - **Hydroponics**: Soil-free systems for efficient growth.
  - **Aquaponics**: Combines hydroponics with fish farming.
  - **Vertical Farming**: Maximizes space efficiency.

## Difficulty Levels
1. **Easy**: Simplified mechanics (e.g., watering plants regularly).
2. **Medium**: Includes soil quality, pest control, and crop rotation.
3. **Hard**: Mimics real-life gardening, requiring precise management of nutrients, water, light, and environmental factors.

## Gameplay Mechanics
### Soil Management
- **Soil Types**:
  - **Sandy**: Drains quickly, low nutrients.
  - **Clay**: Retains water, prone to compaction.
  - **Loamy**: Balanced, ideal for most crops.
  - **Peaty**: High organic matter, excellent for acid-loving plants.
  - **Chalky**: Alkaline, prone to nutrient lock.
  - **Silty**: Retains moisture, high fertility.
- **Soil Metrics**:
  - pH level (acidic, neutral, alkaline).
  - Nutrient levels (nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium).
  - Moisture content.
