Honeybees (Apis mellifera) are eusocial insects known for their role in pollination and honey production. They live in well-organized colonies consisting of a single queen, workers, and drones. Honeybees are vital for ecosystems and agriculture, contributing to the reproduction of flowering plants and the production of honey, beeswax, and other by-products.

**Data**:

- **Habitat**:
  - **Temperature**: Ideal: 15-35°C (59-95°F); can survive -20°C to 40°C (-4°F to 104°F) with hive insulation and support.
  - **Pressure**: 101.3 kPa (1 atm); thrive at standard atmospheric pressure.
  - **Humidity**: 40-60% optimal within the hive; can manage variations by ventilating and regulating hive environment.
  - **Oxygen**: Standard atmospheric levels (19.5-23.5%).
  - **CO2**: Tolerable up to 0.1%; higher levels can harm hive health.
  - **Light**: Diurnal; sensitive to sunlight and use it for navigation and foraging.

- **Nutrition**:
  - **Water**: For cooling and hydration; foragers collect small amounts as needed.
  - **Calories**: Gather nectar and pollen; energy needed to maintain hive temperature and for flight.
  - **Macronutrients**: 
    - **Carbohydrates**: Nectar is converted to honey, providing energy.
    - **Proteins**: Pollen is used for feeding larvae and maintaining adult health.
    - **Fats**: Minimal; present in pollen and used for growth and maintenance.
  - **Vitamins**: B complex from pollen (growth and development).
  - **Minerals**: Calcium, Magnesium, and Potassium from pollen (overall hive health).

- **Production**:
  - **CO2**: Low individual output; collectively, hive ventilation regulates levels.
  - **Waste**: Minimal waste; defecation occurs outside the hive.
  - **Heat**: Hive maintained at 32-35°C for brood development; bees generate heat through shivering.
  - **Honey**: Convert nectar into honey for storage and hive sustenance.

- **Reproduction**:
  - **Method**: Queen lays eggs; drones fertilize during mating flights.
  - **Gestation**: 21 days for worker bees; 24 days for drones; 16 days for queens.
  - **Cycle**: Queen can lay thousands of eggs per day during peak season.
  - **Offspring**: One queen per colony; thousands of worker bees; drones are seasonal.
  - **Care**: Workers feed and care for developing larvae until adulthood.

- **Sleep/Rest**:
  - **Cycle**: Workers rest in short bursts; queens rest intermittently when not laying eggs.
  - **Active Period**: Diurnal; forage during daylight hours.

- **Lifespan**: Workers: 4-6 weeks (longer in winter); Drones: several weeks; Queens: 1-3 years.
- **Growth**:
  - **Maturity**: Workers and drones reach maturity in 2-3 weeks.
  - **Size**: Worker: 12-15 mm; Queen: 18-20 mm; Drone: 15-17 mm.

- **Uses**:
  - **For Humans**: Honey production, beeswax, pollination of crops.
  - **Ecosystem**: Pollinators that support plant reproduction and biodiversity.

- **Special Traits**:
  - **Pollination**: Essential for cross-pollinating flowers and crops, aiding in plant reproduction.
  - **Social Structure**: Live in colonies with a defined caste system (queen, workers, drones).
  - **Communication**: Use the “waggle dance” to convey foraging locations.
  - **Hive Maintenance**: Regulate temperature, build comb structures, and protect against intruders.
  - **Queen Production**: Workers can raise new queens if the current queen fails or dies.
  - **Foraging Efficiency**: Travel up to 5 km from the hive, navigating using the sun and landmarks.
