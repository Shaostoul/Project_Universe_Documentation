Pigs (Sus scrofa domesticus) are highly intelligent and adaptable mammals, domesticated primarily for their meat, but also valued for their utility in agriculture. They are omnivorous and thrive in diverse environments, capable of foraging for a wide variety of foods. Known for their social behavior and quick learning ability, pigs play a significant role in sustainable farming systems.

- **Nutrition**:
  - **Water**: 10-20 liters/day depending on size and climate.
  - **Calories**: 8,000-12,000 kcal/day based on size and activity.
  - **Macronutrients**: 
    - **Carbohydrates**: Root vegetables, grains, and forage.
    - **Proteins**: Plant matter, insects, and supplemental feed.
    - **Fats**: Naturally present in forage and supplements.
  - **Vitamins**: B1, B6, B12 (metabolism and growth), D (bone health).
  - **Minerals**: Calcium (bone structure), Iron (oxygen transport), Selenium (immune function).

- **Production**:
  - **CO2**: Approx. 1-1.5 kg/day; varies with activity and size.
  - **Waste**: 2-4 kg of manure/day.
  - **Heat**: Generate moderate body heat; use wallowing in mud/water for cooling.
  - **Sweat**: Limited sweating; rely on external cooling methods (e.g., water baths).

- **Reproduction**:
  - **Method**: Sexual; live birth.
  - **Gestation**: Approximately 114 days (3 months, 3 weeks, 3 days).
  - **Cycle**: Estrous cycle every 18-24 days.
  - **Offspring**: Litters typically range from 6-12 piglets.
  - **Care**: Piglets weaned around 6-8 weeks.

- **Sleep/Rest**:
  - **Cycle**: Sleeps 8-10 hours/day, often in short intervals.
  - **Active Period**: Diurnal; most active during daylight hours.

- **Lifespan**: 8-15 years; commercial pigs are usually raised for shorter periods (6-12 months for meat production).
- **Growth**:
  - **Maturity**: Reaches full size by 1-2 years.
  - **Size**: Adult weight ranges from 100-300 kg depending on breed; height: 0.5-0.9 meters at the shoulder.

- **Uses**:
  - **For Humans**: Meat production, composting waste, tilling soil.
  - **Ecosystem**: Foragers that help manage plant growth and aerate soil.

- **Special Traits**:
  - **Intelligence**: Highly trainable, capable of solving complex problems.
  - **Social Behavior**: Live in groups; establish social hierarchies.
  - **Foraging Ability**: Efficient at locating food sources, including underground roots.
  - **Adaptability**: Can adjust to a wide range of diets and environments.
  - **Reproductive Efficiency**: High reproductive rate; short gestation and large litters.
  - **Resilience**: Strong immune system; adaptable to varied farming systems and climates.
