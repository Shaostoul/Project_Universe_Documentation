Highland cows (Bos taurus) are a hardy breed of cattle known for their long, shaggy coats and distinctive curved horns. Native to the Scottish Highlands, they are well-adapted to cold, rugged environments. They are primarily raised for their high-quality beef, but their docile nature and resilience also make them suitable for conservation grazing and agricultural landscapes.

**Data**:

- **Habitat**:
  - **Temperature**: Ideal: 5-20°C (41-68°F); Range: -20°C to 30°C (-4°F to 86°F) with shelter during extreme conditions.
  - **Pressure**: 101.3 kPa (1 atm); can adapt to higher altitudes with gradual acclimatization.
  - **Humidity**: 40-70% optimal; high tolerance due to thick coat.
  - **Oxygen**: Standard atmospheric levels (19.5-23.5%); high-altitude capable with gradual adaptation.
  - **CO2**: Tolerable up to 0.1%; similar limits as other mammals.
  - **Light**: Adapted to both bright and dim light conditions; UV protection not typically needed due to coat.

- **Nutrition**:
  - **Water**: 30-50 liters/day depending on size and activity.
  - **Calories**: Around 25,000 kcal/day based on body weight and activity level.
  - **Macronutrients**: 
    - **Carbohydrates**: Primarily from grass and hay.
    - **Proteins**: Grass, forage plants, and supplements.
    - **Fats**: Naturally present in forage.
  - **Vitamins**: A, D, E; essential for growth and health.
  - **Minerals**: Calcium (for bones), Phosphorus (metabolism), Magnesium (muscle function).

- **Production**:
  - **CO2**: Approx. 350-450 grams/day; increases with physical exertion.
  - **Waste**: 30-40 kg of manure/day.
  - **Heat**: Generates body heat to withstand cold environments; thick coat regulates temperature.
  - **Sweat**: Limited sweating; primarily relies on coat and respiration for cooling.

- **Reproduction**:
  - **Method**: Sexual; live birth.
  - **Gestation**: Approximately 9 months.
  - **Cycle**: Estrous cycle every 18-21 days.
  - **Offspring**: Typically 1 calf per birth.
  - **Care**: Calves stay with mother for 6-8 months.

- **Sleep/Rest**:
  - **Cycle**: Sleeps 4-5 hours/day in short intervals; mainly rests while lying down.
  - **Active Period**: Diurnal; most active during daylight hours.

- **Lifespan**: 15-20 years; optimal care can extend lifespan slightly.
- **Growth**:
  - **Maturity**: Reaches full size by 3-4 years.
  - **Size**: Adult weight ranges from 400-800 kg; height: 1.2-1.5 meters at the shoulder.

- **Uses**:
  - **For Humans**: Beef production, conservation grazing, agricultural tourism.
  - **Ecosystem**: Grazers that maintain grassland ecosystems and promote biodiversity.

- **Special Traits**:
  - **Resilience**: Highly resistant to cold, wet environments; thick coat and fat reserves aid survival.
  - **Temperament**: Docile and social; easy to manage in herds.
  - **Adaptability**: Thrives in varied terrains, from highlands to lowlands.
  - **Grazing Efficiency**: Selective grazers that prevent overgrowth of invasive plants, promoting ecological balance.
  - **Reproductive Health**: Typically has fewer birthing complications compared to other breeds.
  - **Lifespan**: Longer-lived than many other cattle breeds, contributing to sustainable agricultural practices.
