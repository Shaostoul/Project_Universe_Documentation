# Asteroids

Asteroids are small, rocky bodies that orbit the Sun, primarily found in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter. They are classified based on their composition and spectral properties into three main types: Carbonaceous (C-type), Metallic (M-type), and Silicaceous (S-type). These classifications provide insights into the conditions and materials present during the early solar system's formation.

## Types of Asteroids

### Carbonaceous (C-type)
- **Description**: C-type asteroids are the most common, making up about 75% of known asteroids. They are rich in carbon, have a dark surface, and are believed to be composed of clay and silicate rocks.
- **Examples**: 253 Mathilde, 101955 Bennu
- **Scientific Interest**: C-type asteroids may contain organic compounds and water, providing clues about the origin of life on Earth.

### Metallic (M-type)
- **Description**: M-type asteroids are primarily composed of metallic nickel and iron. They are less common and are thought to be remnants of the cores of differentiated planetesimals.
- **Examples**: 16 Psyche
- **Scientific Interest**: Studying M-type asteroids helps us understand planetary core formation and the distribution of metals in the solar system.

### Silicaceous (S-type)
- **Description**: S-type asteroids are made of silicate minerals and nickel-iron. They are relatively bright and make up about 17% of known asteroids.
- **Examples**: 433 Eros, 25143 Itokawa
- **Scientific Interest**: S-type asteroids offer insight into the mineralogical composition of the early solar system.

## Storage Format

### Carbonaceous (C-type)
- **ID**: C001
- **Composition**: Clay, Silicates, Organic Compounds
- **Examples**: 253 Mathilde, 101955 Bennu
- **Notes**: Rich in carbon, these asteroids may have played a role in delivering water and organics to Earth.

### Metallic (M-type)
- **ID**: M001
- **Composition**: Nickel, Iron
- **Examples**: 16 Psyche
- **Notes**: Primarily composed of metals, possibly remnants of planetary cores.

### Silicaceous (S-type)
- **ID**: S001
- **Composition**: Silicate Minerals, Nickel-Iron
- **Examples**: 433 Eros, 25143 Itokawa
- **Notes**: Bright asteroids that provide insights into the mineral content of the solar system.
