# Comets

Comets are icy celestial objects that orbit the Sun in highly elliptical paths, which allow them to traverse vast distances across the solar system. These elongated orbits are significant because they reveal the origins of comets, often in distant regions like the Kuiper Belt or the Oort Cloud. As comets interact with the gravitational fields of planets and the Sun, their trajectories provide critical insights into celestial mechanics and the history of the solar system.

As they approach the Sun, the heat causes their ice to vaporize, creating a glowing coma and often a distinctive tail. These ancient travelers are thought to originate from two primary regions in the solar system: the Kuiper Belt and the Oort Cloud. Comets provide valuable resources and scientific insight into the early solar system's composition and conditions.

## Interaction with Comets

As a player in Project Universe, you have the opportunity to interact with comets by deploying specialized drones to collect valuable materials. Here's how the process works:

### Locating a Comet
- Use your ship's scanning equipment to identify comets nearby. They will appear as moving celestial objects with a characteristic glow or tail, indicating their proximity to the Sun.
- Evaluate the comet's type (short-period, long-period, or hyperbolic) to determine the resources it might yield. 
  - **Short-period comets** are more likely to provide water and common organic compounds due to their repeated exposure to the Sun.
  - **Long-period comets** may contain a higher diversity of rare minerals and pristine ice untouched by solar radiation.
  - **Hyperbolic comets**, potentially originating from interstellar space, could offer exotic materials and compounds not found elsewhere.

### Deploying a Drone
- Equip your drone with the appropriate tools for icy and dusty materials.
- Launch the drone toward the comet using your ship's interface. The drone will navigate autonomously to latch onto the comet's surface.

### Collecting Materials
- Drones are equipped with multi-function extraction tools designed to handle various cometary surfaces. These tools include:
  - **Thermal Drills**: Melt through icy layers to access water and organic compounds.
  - **Particle Vacuums**: Collect loose dust and fine particulates from the surface.
  - **Core Samplers**: Extract solid mineral samples from the comet's nucleus.
- Resources are stored within the drone's internal compartments for transport back to your ship.
- Stay alert! The comet's volatile surface may cause minor disruptions, so monitor the drone's progress.

### Returning Home
- Once the drone has completed its collection, recall it to your ship.
- Unload the gathered materials into your ship's storage for processing.

## Processing Comet Materials

The raw materials collected from comets can be processed in your ship's onboard facilities or a designated base. Different facilities may vary in processing efficiency and output:

- **Onboard Facilities**: Provide basic processing capabilities but may take longer and yield lower-quality resources.
- **Designated Bases**: Equipped with advanced machinery for faster processing and higher resource yields, ideal for maximizing the value of rare materials.

Processing yields:

- **Water**: Extracted from cometary ice, essential for sustaining life and generating oxygen.
- **Organic Compounds**: Useful for creating biofuels or synthesizing life-support materials.
- **Rare Minerals**: Occasionally found within the comet's dust, these minerals can be used for crafting advanced technologies.

## Uses of Comet Resources

- **Fuel Production**: Convert organic compounds into biofuels to power your ship and drones.
- **Life Support**: Use water to sustain your crew or grow plants in hydroponic systems.
- **Scientific Discovery**: Analyze collected samples to unlock research bonuses and deepen your understanding of the universe.

By interacting with comets, you gain access to vital resources and uncover secrets of the solar system. This interaction allows you to upgrade your ship's capabilities, enhance drone efficiency, and unlock storyline advancements tied to deeper exploration and discovery in Project Universe.
