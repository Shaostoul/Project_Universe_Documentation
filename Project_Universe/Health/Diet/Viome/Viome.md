### Viome: Personalized Nutrition and Health Optimization

Viome is a health technology company focused on personalized nutrition through microbiome and gene expression testing. By analyzing a person's microbiome and cellular health, Viome offers dietary and lifestyle recommendations tailored to an individual’s unique biology. Their goal is to optimize health by addressing chronic conditions, enhancing energy, and supporting digestive and immune health through diet, supplements, and lifestyle modifications.

The Viome approach is based on data-driven insights from testing gut microbiome diversity, nutrient absorption capability, and metabolic efficiency. Using advanced AI, Viome processes biological samples to provide detailed reports, identifying which foods enhance or inhibit optimal health for each individual. The platform then generates personalized food lists—categorized as Superfoods, Enjoy, Minimize, and Avoid—that guide users on food choices that are beneficial or potentially harmful based on their unique biochemistry.

### Viome Food Categories:

- **Superfoods**: Foods that provide enhanced support for gut health, immune function, and overall wellness.
- **Enjoy**: Foods that are generally beneficial but less impactful than Superfoods.
- **Minimize**: Foods to consume in limited amounts due to moderate negative impacts.
- **Avoid**: Foods likely to disrupt microbiome balance or exacerbate health issues.

Each of these lists is based on Viome’s analysis of your body’s needs, designed to support a balanced microbiome and overall health optimization. Viome continuously refines recommendations as new scientific insights emerge, aiming to empower individuals with knowledge to make informed choices about their diet and lifestyle.
