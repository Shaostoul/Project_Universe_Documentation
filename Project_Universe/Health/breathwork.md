# Starting Point
- Within 30 minutes of waking up go outside for breathwork regardless of weather.
- Ideally sit in chair with a back on it or lay down as lightheadedness is normal.
- Start by exhaling completely.
- Quickly inhale fully raising shoulders trying bringing apex of lung upwards while extending bellybutton straight ahead.
- Quickly exhale fully lowering shoulders while pulling the bellybutton in towards spine.
- On fifth breath exhale fully holding for as long as possible, relax, put tongue to the roof of your mouth, close eyes, get outside of your head; *focus on the noises in your surroundings. **DO NOT sit there thinking about the fact you want to breathe.***
- When you can't hold breath any more breathe in quickly inhaling fully, hold, press tongue to roof of mouth, get outside of your head.
- Then inhale fully holding breath as long as possible; close eyes, listen to surroundings, picture where they are / what they are doing.

# Novice to Master
- Start with 3 rounds of 5 breaths then every new day add 1 breath until reaching 30 breaths per round.

# Best Practices
- Never ever miss breathwork; only requires 4-8 minutes per day.
- Do breathwork at first light exposing as much skin as possible to first light.
