**Vitamins** and **minerals** are both essential nutrients that the body needs to function properly, but they differ in their chemical structure, the way they work in the body, and their food sources. Here's a brief overview of their differences:

1. **Chemical Structure**:
   - **Vitamins**: These are organic compounds, meaning they contain carbon and are derived from living matter. Vitamins can be broken down by heat, air, or acid, which can reduce or eliminate their nutritional value. 
   - **Minerals**: These are inorganic elements sourced from the earth, either consumed directly from plants or from animals that eat plants. Minerals maintain their chemical structure, which means they are not broken down during cooking or digestion.

2. **Function**:
   - **Vitamins**: They play various roles in the body, including serving as co-factors for enzymes, supporting the immune system, keeping nerves healthy, and helping the body produce energy. Some vitamins also act as antioxidants, protecting the body from damage by free radicals.
   - **Minerals**: They are important for building strong bones and teeth, maintaining proper nerve function, contracting and relaxing muscles, and participating in various enzymatic reactions in the body. They also play a role in blood clotting and maintaining a proper balance of fluids.

3. **Classification**:
   - **Vitamins**: They are classified as either water-soluble or fat-soluble. Water-soluble vitamins (e.g., vitamin C and B vitamins) are not stored in the body and need to be consumed regularly, while fat-soluble vitamins (e.g., vitamins A, D, E, and K) can be stored in the body's fat tissues.
   - **Minerals**: They are generally classified as macro (or major) minerals and trace minerals, based on how much of them the body needs. Macro minerals include calcium, magnesium, phosphorus, potassium, and sodium. Trace minerals include iron, manganese, copper, iodine, zinc, and selenium.

4. **Dietary Sources**:
   - **Vitamins**: These can be found in various food groups. For example, fruits and vegetables are rich in vitamins C and A, while dairy and meat often contain vitamins D and B12.
   - **Minerals**: They are found in both plant and animal foods. For instance, dairy products are a primary source of calcium, while red meat and spinach are rich in iron.

5. **Deficiency**:
   - **Vitamins**: Each vitamin has specific functions, and a deficiency can lead to specific health problems. For example, a deficiency in vitamin C can cause scurvy.
   - **Minerals**: Deficiencies can also lead to health problems, such as anemia from iron deficiency or weak bones from a lack of calcium.

In summary, while vitamins and minerals both play critical roles in the body's function and health, they differ in their chemical nature, how they function, and how they are consumed and processed by the body.
