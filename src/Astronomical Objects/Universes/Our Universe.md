An infinite extension of three-dimensional space filled with matter which clumps together via gravity forming astronomical objects of various size such as galaxies, solar systems, stars, planets, and asteroids.
# Matter
Our universe consists of hydrogen fused in the hearts of stars forming increasingly massive elements.
## Atomic Elements
Individual atoms made of electrons, neutrons, and protons. The periodic table of elements lists all currently known atoms: pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/periodic-table
## Molecular Elements
Clumps of molecules made of two or more atoms of the same element bonded together.
## Compounds
A substance made of two or more different elements combined in a fixed ratio.
# Astronomical Objects
**Naturally formed clumps of matter populating our universe including, but not limited to:**
## Definitions
- 1 solar mass = 1.989x10^30kg
- 1 Jupiter mass = 1.898x10^27kg
## Galaxies
Vast systems consisting of stars, star clusters, planetary systems, interstellar gas and dust, and dark matter, all bound together by gravity; often featuring a central supermassive black hole.
## Supermassive Black Holes
Extremely massive black holes typically found at the centers of galaxies >100,000 solar masses.
## Black Holes
Objects whose gravity is so strong that nothing, not even light, can escape. The minimum size of a hydrogen fusing star is ~80 Jupiter masses, the Schwarzschild radius of a black hole born from this star would be ~2.26 kilometers.
## Solar Systems
Objects typically made of one or more stars and/or black holes orbited by planets, dwarf planets, asteroids, and comets.
## Stars
Objects whose mass are capable fusing hydrogen (>80 Jupiter masses.)
## Brown Dwarf
Objects whose mass are incapable fusing hydrogen (>80 Jupiter masses,) but capable of fusing deuterium (<13 Jupiter Masses).
## Planets
Objects whose mass are incapable of fusing deuterium (>13 Jupiter masses,) with sufficient self-gravity to pull themselves into a mostly spherical shape, and have cleared their neighboring region of planetesimals.
## Dwarf Planets
Objects with insufficient mass for their self-gravity to form a mostly spherical shape (>400 kilometers,) hasn't cleared its neighboring region of planetesimals, and isn't the satellite of a planet.
## Asteroids
Rocky/metallic objects whose radius is >1 meter with insufficient mass for their self-gravity to form a mostly spherical shape (<400 kilometers) and is not a comet.
## Comets
Objects whose radius is >1 meter consisting mainly of ice, dust and gas smaller than (<400 kilometers) typically forming a coma and tail while close enough to a star.
## Meteoroids
Objects whose radius is <1 meter.
