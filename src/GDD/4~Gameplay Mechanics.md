**Project Universe: Gameplay Mechanics**

---

**1. Player Character Mechanics**

* **Character Creation & Customization**: Players can design their own avatars, adjusting physical appearance, initial skill sets, and background stories. As they progress, further customization options become available, such as advanced apparel or augmentations.

* **Skill Progression**: As players engage in various activities, their skills improve. A tiered progression system means the more a player performs a task, the more efficient and knowledgeable they become in that domain.

* **Health & Well-being**: A dynamic health system that considers factors like hunger, injury, and mental well-being. Players must keep their character in optimal condition to perform tasks effectively.

---

**2. Resource Management**

* **Inventory System**: A grid-based inventory where items have weight and size. Players need to manage space and ensure they're not over-encumbered.

* **Resource Storage**: Larger items, bulk resources, or crafted goods can be stored within specialized containers in the homeship. Players need to organize and protect these resources.

---

**3. Crafting & Building**

* **Blueprint System**: Players can obtain or design blueprints for various items. Crafting or building requires the blueprint, necessary materials, and the relevant crafting station or workshop.

* **Modularity**: Many items, especially machinery or homeships, are modular. This means players can swap out components or upgrade individual sections without redoing the entire structure.

---

**4. Exploration & Navigation**

* **Stellar Mapping**: A galaxy map allows players to chart courses, mark points of interest, and analyze resource-rich areas. Advanced tech can uncover hidden locations or reveal detailed information about areas.

* **Environmental Interactions**: Depending on where players are, there might be different environmental challenges. Navigating asteroid fields, avoiding stellar anomalies, or exploring derelict ships require skill and sometimes specialized equipment.

---

**5. Combat & Defense**

* **Combat System**: Whether facing alien adversaries or protecting resources from pirates, players can engage in both melee and ranged combat. The combat mechanics consider weapon types, player skills, and environmental factors.

* **Defensive Strategies**: Beyond direct combat, players can set up defenses for their homeships or bases. This includes shields, automated turrets, or strategic traps.

---

**6. Social & Trade Mechanics**

* **Economy & Bartering**: An in-game economy allows for trade of goods and services. Players can set prices based on demand, rarity, or their own valuation.

* **Communication Tools**: From simple text chat to more immersive communication methods, players have tools at their disposal to discuss, plan, and negotiate.

* **Alliances & Guilds**: Players can form groups to collaborate on bigger projects, defend common interests, or simply socialize. These alliances might have shared resources, goals, or territories.

---

**7. Learning & Mentorship**

* **Interactive Tutorials**: Guided sessions that introduce players to various mechanics. These can be initiated by players or suggested based on in-game actions.

* **Skill Workshops**: In-game events where players can learn specific skills faster, sometimes hosted by real-world professionals or experienced players.

* **Challenge Scenarios**: Situational challenges that test a player's knowledge and skill. Successful completion can earn rewards and recognition.

Each of these mechanics serves the broader gameplay loops, ensuring that players have diverse, interconnected activities that challenge their skills, encourage exploration, and drive social interaction.
