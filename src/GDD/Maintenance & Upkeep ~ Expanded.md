# **Maintenance & Upkeep: Expanded**

1. **Self-Care**:
    * **Health & Wellness**: Players must monitor their health, which can be affected by factors like hunger, thirst, fatigue, or exposure to harmful environments.
    * **Nutrition**: Consuming a balanced diet can offer bonuses or perks, while malnutrition can lead to debuffs or health issues.
    * **Rest & Sleep**: Proper rest can recharge the player, perhaps enhancing efficiency in tasks for a short duration.
    * **Mental Well-being**: Engaging in social activities, exploring, or even decorating personal spaces can maintain or boost mental health.

2. **Equipment Care**:
    * **Wear & Tear**: All equipment, from hand tools to armor, degrades with use. Players will regularly need to inspect and repair their gear.
        - **Maintenance Kits**: Players can craft or acquire kits specific to certain equipment types, e.g., armor repair kits or tool sharpening kits.
    * **Upgrade System**: Players can improve equipment efficiency or lifespan by replacing components.
        - **Quality Tiers**: Introduce a tier system for components, allowing players to enhance equipment performance or durability by integrating higher-tier parts.
    * **Specialized Tools**: Some equipment might require specialized tools or stations for maintenance or upgrades.

3. **Homeship Care**:
    * **Exterior Maintenance**: Space debris, cosmic radiation, or external factors can damage the homeship. Players might need to perform spacewalks or send drones for repairs.
    * **Interior Maintenance**: Plumbing, electrical systems, air filtration, etc., might need regular checks and maintenance.
    * **Security & Defense**: Upgrading security systems or defenses to protect against potential threats, be they cosmic or alien.
    * **Energy & Power**: Ensuring that power generators are functional and efficient. Upgrading or repairing them as necessary.
    * **Storage & Organization**: Over time, inventory and storage spaces might get cluttered. Players will need to organize or even upgrade storage solutions.

4. **Machine & Craft Maintenance**:
    * **Operational Checks**: Regularly ensuring machines are functioning at optimal levels.
    * **Component Replacement**: Worn-out or outdated components can be replaced with newer, more efficient parts.
    * **Calibration & Tuning**: Machines might require periodic calibration to ensure they produce quality results.
    * **Cleaning & Decontamination**: Prevent machines from malfunctioning due to accumulated dirt, or ensure that no alien contaminants affect production.

5. **Spacecraft Maintenance**:
    * **Hull Integrity**: Regular checks to ensure the spacecraft's hull isn't compromised.
    * **Engine & Propulsion**: Monitor and maintain engines, thrusters, and fuel systems.
    * **Navigation Systems**: Ensure that navigational tools, sensors, and computers are functioning properly.
    * **Life Support Systems**: Critical for survival in space, these systems need meticulous care.

Maintenance and upkeep tasks, while crucial, should be designed in a way that they don't become too tedious for the player. They should feel meaningful and rewarding, rather than just another chore. Perhaps, over time, players can invest in automation systems or hire NPC assistants to handle routine checks, allowing them to focus on more pressing or engaging tasks. Additionally, visual and audio cues (like a creaky door hinge or a flickering light) can be immersive indicators of needed maintenance.
