Project Universe is meant to provide digital tools helping with and teaching users everything possible initially focused on achieving and maintaining self-sufficiency via homesteading packaged as a downloadable video game accessible/playable/usable on as many different *(sufficiently powerful)* devices as possible *(this can include, but isn't limited to gaming consoles, handheld gaming devices, mobile phones, laptops, desktops, and TVs.)* Not everything can be taught on all devices, but the basics of homesteading can be taught on most for the sake of helping most people across the globe help themselves.

While it is a "game" the tools provided by the game are meant to be usable outside of the game for the purpose of automating, monitoring, designing, and generally assisting with all possible aspects of homesteading. The game provides infinitely configurable virtual environments called biodomes where we can practice homesteading in whatever conditions we desire; environments can be configured to mimic real-life locations, including available resources, where users actually live *(IE: Shaostoul lives in Washington, USA and could configure the game environment to mimic said location to plan how to build their own real-life homestead. Alternatively the game environment could be configured to mimic living on Earth's moon or Mars preparing real-life colonists for life off Earth!)
