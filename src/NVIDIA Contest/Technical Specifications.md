## 3. Data Flow

1. User Input → NLP Processing (NVIDIA NIM) → Query Understanding
2. Query → LlamaIndex Knowledge Retrieval → Relevant Information
3. User Data + Environmental Data → Simulation Engine → Farm State
4. Farm State → AI Advisor (TensorRT-LLM) → Recommendations
5. Recommendations → NeMo Guardrails → Filtered Output
6. Filtered Output → User Interface → User

## 4. API Endpoints (Core)

- `/api/auth`: Authentication and user management
- `/api/farm`: CRUD operations for user's farm data
- `/api/simulate`: Run and retrieve simulation results
- `/api/advice`: Get AI-powered farming advice
- `/api/learn`: Access educational content and quizzes

## 5. Security Measures

- Data Encryption: AES-256 for data at rest, TLS for data in transit
- Input Validation: Server-side validation, prepared statements for DB queries
- Rate Limiting: To prevent API abuse
- Regular Security Audits: Automated and manual penetration testing

## 6. Scalability Considerations

- Microservices Architecture: For independent scaling of components
- Caching Layer: Redis for frequently accessed data
- Load Balancing: AWS Elastic Load Balancer
- Database Sharding: For handling large volumes of simulation data

## 7. Compliance

- GDPR Compliance: For handling EU user data
- WCAG 2.1 AA: For accessibility standards
- Green Hosting: Prioritize eco-friendly data centers

This technical specification provides a high-level overview of the system architecture and key components. It will be continuously updated as the project evolves and new requirements emerge.
